The question is... (0:03:55.73)

to leave me here alone? (0:05:21.00)

The cute girl who summoned... me... (0:05:23.80)

talkin' about, but I'm busy! (0:05:51.03)
▶ Felt : Sorry! Live strong! (0:05:54.55)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : Wait, what? What?! (0:06:00.00)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : Hey, that didn't make you decide to be less
hostile toward me, by any chance, did it? (0:06:04.59)
▶ Ton : Actually, it rained on our
parade and made things worse. (0:06:08.04)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : Yeah, of course... (0:06:10.17)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : Just calm down, Natsuki Subaru. (0:06:11.74)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : Since ancient times, it's the rule that anyone (0:06:13.78)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : summoned into a parallel world
will display supernatural powers! (0:06:15.76)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : I'll mow these guys down and make
them fuel for my shining future! (0:06:18.35)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : You lumps of EXP! (0:06:23.07)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : That's the first time I ever hit someone! (0:06:31.22)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : I didn't expect it to hurt me that much... (0:06:32.69)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : But this world is set up
so that I'll be strong! (0:06:35.29)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : My adrenaline is surging! I've got this! (0:06:38.68)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : I'm sorry! It was all my fault!
Forgive me! Spare me! (0:06:43.57)
▶ Kan : Play games with us, will you?! Die, scum! (0:06:54.66)
▶ Chin : And don't think it'll be painless! (0:07:02.32)
▶ Emilia : That's enough. (0:07:12.50)
▶ Chin : Who the hell are you?! (0:07:27.14)
▶ Emilia : Stop now, and I'll let this slide. (0:07:29.02)
▶ Emilia : So just graciously return what you stole. (0:07:30.86)
▶ Ton : What we stole? (0:07:39.74)
▶ Emilia : Now, please. It's important to me. (0:07:41.15)
▶ Emilia : I'll give up on the other stuff,
but I can't let you have that. (0:07:43.34)
▶ Emilia : Be good and hand it over, please. (0:07:46.81)
▶ Ton : You didn't come to save this kid? (0:07:49.05)
▶ Emilia : What strange clothes he has... (0:07:52.08)
▶ Emilia : If you asked me whether I had any
connection to him, I'd have to say no. (0:07:53.73)
▶ Ton : Then you've got no business with us! (0:07:57.99)
▶ Ton : If someone stole from you,
it was that brat who just ran by! (0:07:59.98)
▶ Kan : Yeah! That way! She ran that way! (0:08:02.52)
▶ Emilia : Hmm... They don't seem to be lying... (0:08:05.53)
▶ Emilia : I need to go after her! (0:08:08.58)
▶ Emilia : But regardless of that... (0:08:14.23)
▶ Emilia : I can't overlook what's going on here. (0:08:16.81)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : Magic? (0:08:25.21)
▶ Chin : Mess with us, will you?! (0:08:26.37)
▶ Chin : I don't care if you can
use magic! I'll kill you! (0:08:29.14)
▶ Chin : You think you can win when
it's two against one?! Huh?! (0:08:31.73)
▶ Emilia : You're right. Two against one may be unfair. (0:08:34.83)
▶ Puck : Two against two should make it fair, then. (0:08:37.72)
▶ Ton : You're a user of the spiritual arts? (0:08:47.05)
▶ Emilia : Correct. Back off now and
I won't come after you. (0:08:49.22)
▶ Emilia : Decide quick. I'm in a hurry. (0:08:52.34)
▶ Chin : You bitch! Next time I see
you, I won't go easy on you! (0:08:54.26)
▶ Puck : Do anything to her, and I'll
haunt you and your kin forever. (0:08:57.75)
▶ Puck : Not that you'll have any kin if I do that. (0:09:00.63)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : You saved me. Thanks. (0:09:08.56)
▶ Emilia : Don't move. (0:09:10.36)
▶ Emilia : See? You averted your eyes because
you have a guilty conscience! (0:09:16.79)
▶ Emilia : Looks like my judgment was spot-on. (0:09:19.80)
▶ Puck : Are you sure? (0:09:22.04)
▶ Puck : I think it was just an
instinctive male reaction. (0:09:23.60)
▶ Puck : I didn't sense any malice at all. (0:09:26.50)
▶ Emilia : You be quiet, Puck. (0:09:28.62)
▶ Emilia : You know who stole my insignia
from me, don't you? (0:09:30.42)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : Uh, sorry, but I don't
have the slightest idea. (0:09:34.13)
▶ Emilia : Huh? Wait, it can't be! (0:09:42.09)
▶ Emilia : Did I really just come around the long way? (0:09:44.28)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : You should probably hurry after her, miss. (0:09:48.08)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : I could... help... (0:09:51.23)
▶ Puck : Aww, you shouldn't have tried to get up. (0:09:52.94)
▶ Puck : What should we do? (0:09:55.57)
▶ Emilia : It's none of our business. (0:09:56.86)
▶ Emilia : He won't die. We'll just leave him. (0:09:58.12)
▶ Puck : Really? (0:10:00.41)
▶ Emilia : Yes, really. (0:10:01.16)
▶ Puck : You say that, but I bet
you'll still help him. (0:10:02.15)
▶ Emilia : I will not! (0:10:04.38)
▶ Puck : Yeah, right. (0:10:05.43)
▶ Emilia : Absolutely not! I am not going to save him! (0:10:06.71)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : She's even super cute when she's mad. (0:10:10.42)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : That's a parallel world fantasy for you... (0:10:14.17)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : Is my head on someone's lap? (0:10:23.75)
▶ Emilia : You're awake? (0:10:26.68)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : I didn't know cute girls were this hairy... (0:10:27.70)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : Wait, that can't be right! (0:10:30.79)
▶ Puck : It's just a thoughtful arrangement we made (0:10:35.33)
▶ Puck : so you could at least feel
happy until you woke up. (0:10:37.42)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : First of all, don't talk in that high voice! (0:10:40.43)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : No sane guy confuses a cat
for the main heroine! (0:10:42.54)
▶ Puck : Aww, making myself bigger was
worth it to see you so happy. (0:10:45.16)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : I'm not happy! (0:10:49.47)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : I'm sorry about this. (0:10:54.43)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : You stayed with me the whole
time I was unconscious... (0:10:56.17)
▶ Emilia : Don't get the wrong idea. (0:10:59.09)
▶ Emilia : I had to stay because there
are things I want to ask you. (0:11:00.48)
▶ Emilia : Healing your wounds and making Puck
your pillow until you woke up (0:11:03.51)
▶ Emilia : were for my own benefit. (0:11:08.49)
▶ Emilia : So I need you to repay me in kind. (0:11:09.99)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : For such a normal favor, you're making
it sound like I really owe you big. (0:11:11.94)
▶ Emilia : No such thing. (0:11:15.90)
▶ Emilia : You have some idea who
stole my insignia, right? (0:11:17.22)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : Insignia? (0:11:20.59)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : You mean one of those badge things
that shows your affiliation? (0:11:21.78)
▶ Emilia : It has a jewel in the center, (0:11:25.35)
▶ Emilia : and it's about this big. (0:11:28.14)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : Sorry, but no matter how many
times you ask me, I have no idea. (0:11:30.48)
▶ Emilia : I see. No helping that, then. (0:11:34.05)
▶ Emilia : But you've given me the information
that you know nothing, (0:11:36.39)
▶ Emilia : and you gave me my answer,
in return for healing you. (0:11:40.17)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : Huh? (0:11:42.93)
▶ Emilia : Well, I'm in a hurry, so I'm going now. (0:11:43.64)
▶ Emilia : Your wounds should be better now, (0:11:46.04)
▶ Emilia : but next time, don't do dangerous things,
like wandering into deserted alleys alone. (0:11:47.85)
▶ Emilia : I'm not concerned. I'm just warning you. (0:11:51.99)
▶ Emilia : If that happens to you again,
saving you won't be of any benefit to me, (0:11:53.65)
▶ Emilia : so don't expect me to help. (0:11:57.76)
▶ Puck : Sorry about her. She's so insincere. (0:12:01.35)
▶ Puck : Don't think badly of her. (0:12:04.25)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : Insincere? (0:12:10.72)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : I think this goes beyond that. (0:12:12.92)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : She was in such a hurry to find
what was stolen from her, (0:12:14.84)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : yet she stopped to help me. (0:12:17.51)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : And she even came up with that lame excuse
for a favor so I wouldn't feel like I owed her, (0:12:19.34)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : even though I'm a total stranger. (0:12:22.87)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : Anyone who lives like that... (0:12:25.06)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : is gonna end up wasting their whole life! (0:12:30.20)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : Hey! Wait up! (0:12:33.89)
▶ Emilia : What? Just so you know, I can only spend
just a little more time with you. (0:12:37.66)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : I sense you're being a tiny bit lenient... (0:12:42.23)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : Forget that. You lost
something important, right? (0:12:44.01)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : Let me help you. (0:12:46.12)
▶ Emilia : But you said you don't know anything... (0:12:47.80)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : But I remember her face, at least! (0:12:49.69)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : If I see her again, I'll know! (0:12:51.53)
▶ Emilia : You're very strange... (0:12:56.80)
▶ Emilia : Just so you know, I can't
do anything to thank you. (0:12:58.68)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : I don't need you to. (0:13:00.75)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : I want to thank you.
That's why I want to help. (0:13:02.59)
▶ Emilia : I didn't do anything deserving of thanks. (0:13:05.54)
▶ Emilia : I told you, I've already received
compensation for healing your wounds. (0:13:07.68)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : Then... (0:13:11.95)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : I'm going to help you for my own sake, too. (0:13:13.48)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : My objective is... Let's see... (0:13:15.87)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : Yeah! One good deed per day! (0:13:18.56)
▶ Puck : I don't sense any malice. I think
you can just accept his offer. (0:13:24.59)
▶ Puck : The more shields between yourself and
ruffians, the better, after all. (0:13:28.54)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : That's what you want me around for?! (0:13:31.45)
▶ Emilia : I mean it, though.
I can't do anything to thank you. (0:13:34.11)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : No problem. Just leave it to me! (0:13:37.00)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : I talked big, but isn't this town too
huge to find one little thing in? (0:13:56.32)
▶ Emilia : It's the capital of Lugunica. (0:14:01.68)
▶ Emilia : You didn't even know that, um... (0:14:03.76)
▶ Puck : That's right. We haven't
asked your name yet. (0:14:06.64)
▶ Puck : Should we all introduce ourselves? (0:14:09.73)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : Oh, yeah, you're right. (0:14:11.41)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : I'll introduce myself first, then. (0:14:12.93)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : My name is Natsuki Subaru. (0:14:16.38)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : Not only am I clueless,
I'm also broke beyond compare! (0:14:18.45)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : Nice to meet ya! (0:14:21.43)
▶ Puck : When that's all you say,
you really do sound hopeless. (0:14:22.36)
▶ Puck : And I'm Puck! Nice to meet you! (0:14:25.86)
▶ Emilia : It's very unusual to see someone who
can touch a spirit so casually. (0:14:31.33)
▶ Emilia : Where are you from? (0:14:35.22)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : Well, following the usual pattern,
a small island nation to the east. (0:14:36.85)
▶ Emilia : Lugunica is the easternmost
nation on our continental map. (0:14:41.15)
▶ Emilia : There's no nation east of here. (0:14:44.96)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : No way, really?
There's nothing east of here? (0:14:46.90)
▶ Emilia : You have no idea where you
are, you have no money, (0:14:49.39)
▶ Emilia : you can't read, and you have
no one who can help you. (0:14:53.71)
▶ Emilia : You might be in an even more
precarious position than me, um... (0:14:56.47)
▶ Emilia : Subaru... was it? (0:14:59.74)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : Yes, that's my name. (0:15:03.86)
▶ Puck : But when I look at you this way,
you look pretty well-built. (0:15:06.05)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : I do work out every day. (0:15:09.49)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : For a shut-in who's gotta guard
his house, that much is a given. (0:15:11.53)
▶ Emilia : I'm not sure I understand
what a "shut-in" is, (0:15:16.02)
▶ Emilia : but that means you're from a
respectable family, right? (0:15:19.03)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : H-Hey— (0:15:22.12)
▶ Emilia : Your fingers, too. They're very pretty. (0:15:23.27)
▶ Emilia : They're evidence that you don't
live like a peasant at all. (0:15:25.94)
▶ Emilia : And your muscles don't look like
the kind you gain by working. (0:15:28.74)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : Uh, anyway, I know your cat's name now, (0:15:33.07)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : but I haven't heard yours yet. (0:15:36.16)
▶ Emilia : My name? (0:15:37.96)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : Yeah. (0:15:39.07)
▶ Emilia : I'm... (0:15:40.61)
▶ Emilia : Satella. (0:15:44.09)
▶ Emilia : I have no family name.
You can just call me Satella. (0:15:46.16)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : I see... Satella... (0:15:50.17)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : That's a nice name. (0:15:54.07)
▶ Puck : You have terrible taste. (0:15:59.89)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : Okay, time to get back to asking around! (0:16:03.14)
▶ Emilia : Hey, Subaru... (0:16:08.14)
▶ Emilia : Do you get the feeling that child is lost? (0:16:10.08)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : Uh, but what about our questioning? (0:16:17.01)
▶ Emilia : That's important too, but if she's
lost, we have to do something. (0:16:19.24)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : I'm in no place to talk after you saved me, (0:16:25.53)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : but do you understand the position we're in? (0:16:28.03)
▶ Emilia : But... (0:16:30.87)
▶ Emilia : She's crying! Is she not, Subaru? (0:16:32.79)
▶ Emilia : If you can't do this with me, that's fine. (0:16:37.45)
▶ Emilia : Thanks for all your help, Subaru. (0:16:39.87)
▶ Emilia : I'll handle it on my own from here, (0:16:42.20)
▶ Emilia : after I help that little girl. (0:16:44.30)
▶ Emilia : I'm sorry I'm not who you were looking for. (0:16:51.97)
▶ Emilia : So, what's the matter? (0:16:54.63)
▶ Emilia : Aren't your mom and dad with you? (0:16:56.20)
▶ Emilia : Um, uh... Don't cry... (0:17:03.36)
▶ Emilia : I won't do anything to you, okay? (0:17:06.10)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : What I have here is one
grooved-edge ten-yen coin. (0:17:08.76)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : I will now clutch it tightly in my hand. (0:17:13.59)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : Tight, tight, tight... like that! (0:17:17.04)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : And now... Imagine that! (0:17:19.47)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : And this... is where the coin was hiding. (0:17:25.98)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : You can have this. (0:17:32.52)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : It's rare, so take good care of it. (0:17:33.99)
▶ EXTRA : Thank you! (0:17:38.85)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : I see. You got separated from your mom, huh? (0:17:40.96)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : Hey, it'll be fine. (0:17:43.87)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : Just leave it to me and
this young lady here. (0:17:46.28)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : We'll find them for you in no time. (0:17:48.84)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : When we do this, (0:17:52.44)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : people who don't know us probably think
we're a married couple and child, huh? (0:17:53.88)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : How embarrassing. (0:17:58.73)
▶ Emilia : At best, I can't see you as anything
more than her older brother. (0:17:59.62)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : What makes you think I'm that
much younger than you?! (0:18:03.43)
▶ EXTRA : Oh! Mommy! (0:18:05.82)
▶ EXTRA : Mommy! (0:18:10.20)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : Looks like she found her. (0:18:12.16)
▶ Emilia : Yeah. I'm glad. (0:18:13.84)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : So... (0:18:16.78)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : I think we took a pretty long way around, (0:18:18.07)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : but what benefit will you insist
that you got out of this? (0:18:20.78)
▶ Emilia : That's easy. Now we can continue our
search with our minds at ease, right? (0:18:25.20)
▶ Emilia : Anyway, why did you help me? (0:18:30.49)
▶ Emilia : You were against the idea. (0:18:33.05)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : I could say I just wanted
to show off my magic trick, (0:18:34.74)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : but that would be a lie. (0:18:36.80)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : I told you, finding your insignia will
be my one good deed for the day! (0:18:38.30)
▶ Emilia : Then, since you helped the little girl,
isn't your one good deed over? (0:18:42.70)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : That comeback was way too logical! (0:18:46.72)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : Come on, it doesn't hurt to do more
than one nice thing in a day, right? (0:18:48.86)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : I just got tomorrow's out of the way. (0:18:51.85)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : My plan is to get a week's worth
of good deeds taken care of early! (0:18:53.56)
▶ Emilia : Subaru, you're the type that basically
wastes your whole life, aren't you? (0:18:57.32)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : You're the last one I
want saying that to me. (0:19:00.69)
▶ Emilia : You're not a bad boy, though. (0:19:04.17)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : Why are you treating me like
I'm younger than you again? (0:19:05.85)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : I doubt there's that much
difference between us. (0:19:08.36)
▶ Emilia : I don't think making guesses
on that will help you. (0:19:11.13)
▶ Emilia : I'm a half-elf. (0:19:14.42)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : Now I get it. (0:19:21.66)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : No wonder I thought you were so cute! (0:19:24.23)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : Elves are always beautiful, right? (0:19:27.13)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : What? (0:19:32.18)
▶ Emilia : "What"? Well, I mean... I'm a half-elf... (0:19:33.14)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : Yeah, I heard you. (0:19:37.16)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : What'd you do that for? (0:19:48.26)
▶ Puck : I just had to do something about
this unbearable tingle I feel! (0:19:50.01)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : I can't accept being hit
for a reason like that. (0:19:53.30)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : Though I'll forgive you
because it was squishy. (0:19:56.49)
▶ Puck : I didn't hit you out of anger or anything. (0:19:58.03)
▶ Puck : The opposite, in fact. (0:20:00.46)
▶ Emilia : Subaru, you're such a dunderhead! (0:20:02.71)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : Dunderhead? Who says that
in this day and age? (0:20:05.03)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : And why are you insulting me? (0:20:07.54)
▶ Emilia : Hmph! Whatever! (0:20:09.77)
▶ Emilia : More importantly, we have
to get back to the search. (0:20:11.37)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : Hey, hang on! (0:20:15.76)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : Running around without
a plan never ends well. (0:20:17.29)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : There's a basic rule of searches. (0:20:20.16)
▶ Emilia : A basic rule of searches? (0:20:21.78)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : Yep. You revisit the crime
scene a hundred times. (0:20:22.99)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : Where was your insignia stolen? (0:20:25.29)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : So you see, it seems the crime
happened right around here, (0:20:27.59)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : so I came back to this fruit stand after
valiantly telling her to leave it all to me. (0:20:30.89)
▶ Kadomon Risch : What? I thought I had a customer,
but it's just the broke kid? (0:20:34.56)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : Do you really want to take that attitude? (0:20:38.28)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : Haven't you noticed I'm
not who I was before? (0:20:40.32)
▶ Kadomon Risch : What? (0:20:42.99)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : Just look who I brought with me! (0:20:44.22)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : I brought someone who just
might become a regular! (0:20:46.19)
▶ Emilia : Um, Subaru... (0:20:49.40)
▶ Emilia : You seem to have some
weird expectations of me, (0:20:51.17)
▶ Emilia : but I don't have any money, either. (0:20:53.58)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : Huh?! Seriously? (0:20:55.90)
▶ Kadomon Risch : So what did you want to say to me now
that I've got two broke customers, boy? (0:20:57.85)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : We're actually looking for someone, (0:21:03.51)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : and we hoped we could ask
you some questions... (0:21:05.99)
▶ Kadomon Risch : That was a sarcastic way of telling you I
don't have time for losers with no money! (0:21:08.62)
▶ Kadomon Risch : Get outta here! (0:21:11.90)
▶ EXTRA : Mister! (0:21:13.25)
▶ EXTRA : Thanks for your help earlier. (0:21:15.55)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : What brings you back here? (0:21:17.25)
▶ EXTRA : It's my husband's shop,
so we were just stopping by. (0:21:19.22)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : Husband? (0:21:23.31)
▶ Kadomon Risch : Hey, there's my girl. (0:21:29.19)
▶ Kadomon Risch : Wait, you know these broke losers? (0:21:31.59)
▶ EXTRA : She got lost, and they found her. (0:21:35.42)
▶ EXTRA : Here, lady. (0:21:41.07)
▶ EXTRA : Please accept it. (0:21:45.64)
▶ EXTRA : She wants to thank you in her own way. (0:21:47.37)
▶ Emilia : Thank you. (0:21:53.27)
▶ Kadomon Risch : Sorry about that. (0:22:02.80)
▶ Kadomon Risch : You helped my daughter,
and I want to thank you. (0:22:04.62)
▶ Kadomon Risch : You can ask for anything. (0:22:07.33)
▶ Emilia : There, you see? (0:22:11.83)
▶ Emilia : That came back around
and worked in our favor! (0:22:13.03)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : The air, the atmosphere, and most likely, (0:22:34.02)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : the attitudes of the people
living here are awful. (0:22:36.44)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : Are you sure she's here? (0:22:38.85)
▶ Kadomon Risch : It might be that Felt girl. (0:22:41.55)
▶ Kadomon Risch : You said a nimble little blond girl, right? (0:22:44.28)
▶ Kadomon Risch : She's well-known in the slums.
Dunno where she lives, though. (0:22:46.81)
▶ Emilia : Maybe someone will tell us if we ask. (0:22:51.75)
▶ Puck : No one would sell out one of their own,
so I don't think that would work. (0:22:54.02)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : Maybe we should come back later. (0:22:58.80)
▶ Puck : Whether you stay or leave,
you should decide quickly. (0:23:01.42)
▶ Puck : I'm almost out of time. (0:23:04.89)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : You're what? Out of time? (0:23:06.74)
▶ Puck : I have a cute appearance, but I am a spirit. (0:23:08.74)
▶ Puck : It take a lot of mana just
to appear in physical form. (0:23:12.33)
▶ Puck : So at night, I return to
the crystal I was summoned from (0:23:15.97)
▶ Puck : and prepare for the
emergence of the sun. (0:23:18.71)
▶ Puck : On average, my ideal staying time
is from about nine to five. (0:23:22.14)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : Nine to five? You sound
like a civil servant. (0:23:25.71)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : Employment terms for spirits are
more severe than I thought... (0:23:28.41)
▶ Emilia : We'll be fine without Puck.
We have to move forward. (0:23:31.56)
▶ Puck : Yeah. But, sorry... I'm at my limit... (0:23:34.68)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : It's almost like he's dying
when he disappears... (0:23:39.35)
▶ Emilia : Sorry to work you so hard, Puck. (0:23:41.56)
▶ Emilia : We'll handle things from
here, so get some rest. (0:23:43.89)
▶ Puck : Don't do anything reckless. (0:23:49.82)
▶ Puck : If it comes down to it,
use the odo to summon me again. (0:23:52.12)
▶ Puck : Okay, take care of the rest, Subaru. (0:23:56.25)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : Hey, I haven't been alone with a
girl since I was in grade school! (0:24:09.01)
▶ Emilia : Don't get any weird ideas. (0:24:13.95)
▶ Emilia : I can use magic. (0:24:16.06)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : I won't! (0:24:17.67)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : The bigger issue is how
we should find Felt now. (0:24:19.35)
▶ Emilia : I'll ask the lesser spirits. (0:24:22.92)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : Lesser spirits? (0:24:25.21)
▶ Emilia : Lesser spirits are beings that
haven't become spirits yet. (0:24:26.62)
▶ Emilia : They grow over time, and when they
gain strength and self-awareness, (0:24:30.90)
▶ Emilia : they become full spirits, like Puck. (0:24:34.56)▶ Emilia : I'll ask once more. (0:00:20.04)
▶ Emilia : Why did you call me by the
name of the Jealous Witch? (0:00:22.38)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : Because you told me to. (0:00:25.68)
▶ Emilia : I don't know who told you that, (0:00:27.11)
▶ Emilia : but they have terrible taste! (0:00:28.84)
▶ Emilia : The Jealous Witch is the epitome of taboo, (0:00:30.58)
▶ Emilia : and you call me by her name,
which most dare not even say! (0:00:33.04)
▶ EXTRA : That's right! (0:00:36.55)
▶ EXTRA : That's going too far, boy! (0:00:37.56)
▶ Emilia : If you have nothing to say, I'm leaving.
I have things to do. (0:00:40.09)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : Felt! (0:00:48.45)
▶ Emilia : Were you stalling me? (0:01:01.77)
▶ Emilia : Are you working with her?! (0:01:03.26)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : N-No! (0:01:04.85)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : Hey... W-Wait a minute! (0:01:07.50)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : You have it all wrong! I'm... (0:01:09.46)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : Damn it! (0:01:14.69)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : Could someone just treat me a little nicer? (0:02:53.13)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : Why was I even... (0:02:57.72)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : summoned to this world? (0:03:01.75)
▶ Kan : What are you babbling about? (0:03:05.39)
▶ Chin : If you don't wanna get hurt, cough up
whatever you've got! (0:03:07.53)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : Would you stop it already?! (0:03:12.93)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : No one is this damn persistent! (0:03:14.96)
▶ Chin : You think you can mouth off to us? (0:03:17.53)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : You're in my way! I have somewhere I have to go! (0:03:19.70)
▶ Ton : Man, now you've done it. (0:03:31.24)
▶ Ton : You stabbed him? (0:03:33.61)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : You've gotta be kidding me... (0:03:33.95)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : It hurts... It hurts... (0:03:35.66)
▶ Chin : N-No! He walked right into my blade! (0:03:35.81)
▶ Ton : What are you doing? (0:03:41.49)
▶ Kan : Well, no sense in wasting it. (0:03:42.89)
▶ Kan : Take anything on him that's worth selling! (0:03:44.62)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : Huh? (0:03:45.82)
▶ Ton : Whoa, wait! The guards will be here any second! (0:03:46.85)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : But Old Man Rom ate those. (0:03:51.24)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : How? (0:03:54.11)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : C-Could... this be... (0:03:56.39)
▶ Chin : Run! We're in trouble! (0:03:59.78)
▶ Kadomon Risch : Well, boy? You want this appa? (0:04:12.96)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : Hey, mister... (0:04:16.50)
▶ Kadomon Risch : Huh? (0:04:18.19)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : How many times have you seen me now? (0:04:19.22)
▶ Kadomon Risch : What do you mean? I've never seen you before. (0:04:21.65)
▶ Kadomon Risch : Well? Are you buying it or not? (0:04:24.53)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : Sorry, but I'm broke beyond compare! (0:04:29.75)
▶ Kadomon Risch : Get the hell outta here! (0:04:32.93)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : Wallet, cell phone, corn potage snack, cup noodles. (0:04:35.63)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : My tracksuit and sneakers are intact, too. (0:04:39.29)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : And naturally... (0:04:42.34)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : Thank god. A wound to the back
is a warrior's greatest shame. (0:04:46.32)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : Well, with so much circumstantial
evidence, there's no denying it. (0:04:52.98)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : It's kinda hard to believe, but this has to be... (0:04:58.00)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : A time leap. (0:05:01.83)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : And each time, I return to my initial state. (0:05:03.27)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : I'll call it (0:05:06.15)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : "Return by Death." (0:05:07.64)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : I actually get a time-leap ability,
and it only activates when I die. (0:05:14.37)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : The precondition being pitiful is so typical. (0:05:18.69)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : If I've gone back in time, Satella hasn't
helped me in this fourth life. (0:05:22.07)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : Meaning the debt I owed her for saving me is gone. (0:05:28.28)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : In that case, I should forget everything, sell this, (0:05:32.79)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : save some funds, and use my knowledge
of the modern world to live in luxury! (0:05:37.13)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : My dream is taking shape before my eyes! (0:05:41.55)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : Right, mister? (0:05:43.91)
▶ EXTRA : Wh-Why are you asking me? (0:05:45.38)
▶ EXTRA : I have no idea what you're talking about. (0:05:47.46)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : Aw, that's cold... (0:05:50.32)
▶ EXTRA : I don't wanna get caught up
in other people's problems. (0:05:52.40)
▶ EXTRA : Don't talk to me. (0:05:55.71)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : Well, I guess "Let sleeping dogs
lie," applies in any world. (0:05:58.59)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : But still, there are always softies (0:06:04.97)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : who help others, even when
they really can't afford to... (0:06:08.32)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : She'd just had something precious stolen. (0:06:12.01)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : She didn't have time for me. (0:06:14.16)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : Yet she saved some useless stranger, (0:06:16.45)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : and even healed him. (0:06:18.87)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : Then she let that useless stranger
be pleased with himself... (0:06:20.77)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : Even if Satella doesn't know me, (0:06:49.72)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : Felt still stole her insignia. And Elsa will... (0:06:53.79)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : No matter how many times I repeat
this, that won't change. (0:06:58.75)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : They say history repeats itself, right? (0:07:01.82)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : Yeah. (0:07:10.85)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : If I have knowledge that people
I used to know will be killed, (0:07:11.93)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : I can't just ignore it! (0:07:17.73)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : Hey, mister... (0:07:24.92)
▶ Kadomon Risch : What do you want, broke kid? (0:07:26.84)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : There's something I want to ask you... (0:07:29.13)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : Have there been any pickpocketing
incidents around here? (0:07:31.56)
▶ Kadomon Risch : Asking questions, without buying anything?
You really do have guts. (0:07:34.38)
▶ Kadomon Risch : Incidents like that aren't uncommon at all. (0:07:38.85)
▶ Kadomon Risch : Though, that last one was unusual... (0:07:41.65)
▶ Kadomon Risch : They threw some magic around
in the street a few times. (0:07:45.14)
▶ Kadomon Risch : Things that looked like icicles flew
around and lodged in the wall. (0:07:48.07)
▶ Kadomon Risch : But they disappeared fast. (0:07:51.01)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : I'm too late? (0:07:52.49)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : I thought if I could keep the insignia
from being stolen, then maybe... (0:07:53.95)
▶ Kadomon Risch : Maybe what? (0:07:57.77)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : Oh, just talking to myself, but... (0:07:59.27)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : Thanks, mister... For telling me,
even though I didn't buy anything. (0:08:02.60)
▶ Kadomon Risch : It's no big deal. (0:08:06.63)
▶ Kadomon Risch : A broke kid, like you, just helped my
daughter after she got lost earlier. (0:08:08.59)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : I guess fate is a compelling force, too... (0:08:14.71)
▶ Kadomon Risch : What are you smiling about? (0:08:19.15)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : Nothing. (0:08:20.60)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : I'll buy an appa next time! (0:08:22.29)
▶ Kadomon Risch : Sure. Buy one, and you'll be a customer. (0:08:24.68)
▶ Kadomon Risch : Get to work, broke kid! (0:08:26.92)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : Right! (0:08:29.06)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : This means there's only one way. (0:08:30.93)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : Before Elsa comes to the loot house, (0:08:33.27)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : I have to buy the insignia from
Felt, and return it to Satella! (0:08:35.17)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : Wait... (0:08:38.09)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : Satella was just an alias, wasn't it? (0:08:38.93)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : Then I've gotta get her to tell
me her real name this time— (0:08:42.25)
▶ Kan : What are you babbling about? (0:08:49.83)
▶ Chin : If you don't wanna get hurt, cough up
whatever you've got! (0:08:52.09)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : I'm getting sick of seeing your faces,
Larry, Moe, and Curly. (0:08:55.28)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : After doing this four times,
I've learned my lesson! (0:08:58.77)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : Guards! (0:09:08.74)
▶ Kan : What the hell, you bastard?! (0:09:10.74)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : My memory from before was right. (0:09:13.46)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : This world does have some kind of police force! (0:09:15.86)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : Someone! P-Please, I need a man! (0:09:19.30)
▶ Chin : Damn it, shut up! (0:09:22.97)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : No, don't touch me... Stop. (0:09:23.94)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : I can't hear you. You're not being sincere enough. (0:09:25.94)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : Police... Huh? (0:09:29.09)
▶ Ton : Don't scare me like that. (0:09:33.61)
▶ Ton : I might have freaked out, just a little. (0:09:35.23)
▶ Chin : Just a little bit. (0:09:37.87)
▶ Kan : Just a tiny, little bit. (0:09:39.51)
▶ Kan : Trying to run won't help you. (0:09:43.12)
▶ Reinhard van Astrea : That's enough. (0:09:46.97)
▶ Ton : Red hair. (0:09:53.30)
▶ Ton : And a knight's sword, with scratches
made by dragon claws. (0:09:55.14)
▶ Ton : It can't be. (0:09:58.28)
▶ Ton : Reinhard? (0:09:59.63)
▶ Ton : The master swordsman, Reinhard? (0:10:01.10)
▶ Reinhard van Astrea : Seems I needn't introduce myself. (0:10:03.33)
▶ Reinhard van Astrea : Although, that nickname is a bit much. (0:10:06.24)
▶ Reinhard van Astrea : I don't know how much my modest
strength could aid him. (0:10:09.78)
▶ Reinhard van Astrea : But if you wish to resort to extreme measures, (0:10:13.19)
▶ Reinhard van Astrea : as a knight, I would have to fight back. (0:10:15.85)
▶ Ton : S-Screw this! It's not worth it! (0:10:19.50)
▶ Reinhard van Astrea : I'm glad we're both safe. Are you unhurt? (0:10:27.14)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : A-Allow me to thank you, from the bottom
of my heart, for saving my life! (0:10:33.05)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : I, Natsuki Subaru,
deeply admire your selflessness! (0:10:38.51)
▶ Reinhard van Astrea : No need for such formality. (0:10:42.88)
▶ Reinhard van Astrea : Once it was three against two,
they lost their advantage. (0:10:45.57)
▶ Reinhard van Astrea : If I'd been alone, it would have been different. (0:10:50.05)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : H-His nice-guy index is off the charts. (0:10:52.23)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : Uh... Reinhard-san, right? (0:10:58.17)
▶ Reinhard van Astrea : You may just call me "Reinhard," Subaru. (0:11:02.17)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : He closed our distance like it was nothing... (0:11:05.32)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : Well, thanks again, Reinhard. (0:11:07.86)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : You're the only one who heard me
shouting and came to help... (0:11:10.51)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : Talk about lonely. (0:11:14.03)
▶ Reinhard van Astrea : For most, it's too risky to face off
against people like them. (0:11:16.39)
▶ Reinhard van Astrea : As far as it goes, you were
right to call for the guards. (0:11:21.09)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : Are you a guard? (0:11:25.94)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : You don't look like one... (0:11:28.91)
▶ Reinhard van Astrea : I'm off duty today, so I'm not in uniform. (0:11:30.98)
▶ Reinhard van Astrea : And I realize that I don't appear
particularly intimidating. (0:11:33.94)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : Come to think of it, didn't they
call you a master swordsman? (0:11:37.90)
▶ Reinhard van Astrea : My family is fairly unique. (0:11:41.71)
▶ Reinhard van Astrea : Every day, I feel I'll be crushed
by their expectations. (0:11:44.22)
▶ Reinhard van Astrea : Anyway, Subaru... (0:11:48.91)
▶ Reinhard van Astrea : You have quite the unusual
hair, apparel, and name. (0:11:50.26)
▶ Reinhard van Astrea : What nation are you from? (0:11:53.86)
▶ Reinhard van Astrea : At the moment, Lugunica is a bit
more restive than in peacetime. (0:11:56.11)
▶ Reinhard van Astrea : If you have a problem, I'd be glad to help you. (0:12:00.11)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : Would you come to the loot house? (0:12:04.25)
▶ Reinhard van Astrea : The loot house? (0:12:05.81)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : N-Never mind... Forget it. (0:12:08.34)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : I can't trouble you with that... (0:12:12.96)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : I'll handle the rest on my own, somehow. (0:12:15.23)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : But... I'd appreciate it if you
could deliver a message. (0:12:18.92)
▶ Reinhard van Astrea : I'd be glad to, of course. (0:12:22.96)
▶ Reinhard van Astrea : To whom? And what? (0:12:24.75)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : Well, I don't know her name, but... (0:12:26.95)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : Have you seen a girl with white
robes and silver hair nearby? (0:12:30.69)
▶ Reinhard van Astrea : White robes and silver hair? (0:12:34.81)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : She's also extremely gorgeous! (0:12:37.32)
▶ Reinhard van Astrea : No, I haven't. (0:12:41.21)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : Then, if you do see her, (0:12:43.20)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : tell her not to go near the loot
house, no matter what. (0:12:45.32)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : I'll find what she's looking for
and bring it to her myself. (0:12:49.13)
▶ Reinhard van Astrea : Very well. If I see her,
I shall relay your message. (0:12:53.70)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : Thanks. (0:12:57.74)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : I'll repay you one day! (0:13:00.34)
▶ Reinhard van Astrea : All right. (0:13:02.60)
▶ Reinhard van Astrea : Take care. (0:13:04.28)
▶ EXTRA : Felt's den? (0:13:09.00)
▶ EXTRA : Yeah, just go two streets down that way. (0:13:11.35)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : Thanks, I appreciate it, bro. (0:13:14.58)
▶ EXTRA : Don't mention it, bro. Live strong. (0:13:17.01)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : The question is whether Felt will return there... (0:13:21.25)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : I'd rather catch her before she
goes to the loot house, (0:13:24.55)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : and trade her the cell phone for the insignia— (0:13:27.60)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : Whoa! (0:13:30.51)
▶ Elsa Granhiert : Oh, dear! (0:13:31.51)
▶ Elsa Granhiert : I'm sorry. Are you all right? (0:13:32.49)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : Yeah, I'm fine. (0:13:34.39)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : I don't look it, but toughness
is one thing I... have... (0:13:36.00)
▶ Elsa Granhiert : What's wrong? (0:13:48.52)
▶ Elsa Granhiert : You don't have to be so scared.
I won't do anything to you. (0:13:49.77)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : I... I'm not scared... (0:13:53.60)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : What gave you that idea? (0:13:56.46)
▶ Elsa Granhiert : Your scent. (0:13:58.22)
▶ Elsa Granhiert : When people are scared, I can smell their fear. (0:13:59.49)
▶ Elsa Granhiert : Right now, you're frightened. (0:14:05.06)
▶ Elsa Granhiert : You're also angry, aren't you? (0:14:07.27)
▶ Elsa Granhiert : At me. (0:14:10.20)
▶ Elsa Granhiert : It's fine. (0:14:19.81)
▶ Elsa Granhiert : I'm a little curious, but this isn't
the time to start a commotion. (0:14:21.65)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : That's not a very nice thing to say... (0:14:25.78)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : If you're too scary,
that beauty will go to waste— (0:14:28.07)
▶ Elsa Granhiert : Oh, very good. (0:14:30.60)
▶ Elsa Granhiert : Conceal your hostility,
and you'll be even better. (0:14:32.25)
▶ Elsa Granhiert : Well, I'll be going now. (0:14:37.38)
▶ Elsa Granhiert : Something tells me we'll meet again. (0:14:39.69)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : Someone actually lives here? (0:14:57.81)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : Elsa hasn't already been here
and trashed it, has she? (0:15:03.30)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : I-It's fine, I'm sure... (0:15:08.00)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : I don't smell blood. (0:15:10.09)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : But it does smell like garbage. (0:15:11.64)
▶ Felt : What do you think you're doing,
peeking into someone's house? (0:15:15.22)
▶ Felt : Sorry, but there's nothing worth stealing in there. (0:15:19.46)
▶ Felt : Beat it! (0:15:22.98)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : No, wait! That's not what I was doing... (0:15:24.22)
▶ Felt : Shut up! Don't argue! (0:15:26.18)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : Whoa, stop... (0:15:26.84)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : Calm down! This is no time to fight! (0:15:28.37)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : Before it gets dark— (0:15:30.40)
▶ Felt : Before it gets dark, you'd better be gone. (0:15:33.03)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : I told you, you've got it all wrong... (0:15:35.44)
▶ Felt : You don't give up, do you? (0:15:48.78)
▶ Felt : I told you to get out of here! (0:15:50.85)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : Just listen to me! (0:15:53.32)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : P-Please! Just hear me out, Felt! (0:16:11.60)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : I came to see you on important business! (0:16:15.36)
▶ Felt : How do you know my name? (0:16:17.56)
▶ Felt : You want me to steal something for you? (0:16:19.67)
▶ Felt : You should have said that first! (0:16:21.63)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : You're the one who attacked me right away. (0:16:23.19)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : You know, this is a greedy business you're running! (0:16:25.92)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : Do you pride yourself on sticky fingers? (0:16:27.90)
▶ Felt : It's all a matter of how to stay alive. (0:16:29.60)
▶ Felt : If it weren't this, I'd have no
choice but to sell my body. (0:16:31.59)
▶ Felt : So, what's your business with me? (0:16:34.28)
▶ Felt : Spit it out. (0:16:36.12)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : There's one thing I want. (0:16:38.26)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : Here and now, I want to buy the insignia you stole! (0:16:39.95)
▶ Felt : You aren't associated with my client. (0:16:42.87)
▶ Felt : Are you a business rival? (0:16:46.23)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : Call her a rival, or call her the
one who killed my parents... (0:16:48.31)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : Or even the one who killed me! (0:16:51.90)
▶ Felt : You make no sense. (0:16:54.14)
▶ Felt : Well, I'm only interested in selling
to whoever pays most. (0:16:55.85)
▶ Felt : If you've got an offer that might
be profitable, I'll listen. (0:17:00.47)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : Very shrewd... (0:17:03.73)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : I have something worth more
than twenty holy coins. (0:17:06.02)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : I want to buy your insignia with it. (0:17:10.08)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : It's what everyone wants these days, a metia. (0:17:12.84)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : That is the power of a metia! (0:17:18.99)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : It's a one-of-a-kind item that can capture
and stop a moment in time. (0:17:21.18)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : So, how about it? (0:17:26.10)
▶ Felt : You don't seem to be lying. (0:17:28.12)
▶ Felt : But that's supposed to be me?
I'm way prettier. (0:17:30.51)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : If you look this good without makeup,
you're doing fine... (0:17:33.70)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : Don't complain. (0:17:36.48)
▶ Felt : Well, it is unusual. I'll give you that. (0:17:37.68)
▶ Felt : But twenty holy coins? Not likely. (0:17:40.47)
▶ Felt : I'm not so stupid as to believe, without question, (0:17:43.71)
▶ Felt : everything a prospective buyer says. (0:17:46.89)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : Well, of course not. (0:17:50.25)
▶ Felt : At the far edge of the slums is a loot house. (0:17:52.82)
▶ Felt : The fair thing is to have the codger who
lives there, Old Man Rom, appraise it. (0:17:55.38)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : So it still comes to that... (0:18:01.20)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : Okay, got it. Let's go. (0:18:03.57)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : Right now... Let's move. (0:18:05.59)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : On the double! (0:18:07.13)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : We'll have him take a look,
and get right out of there! (0:18:08.43)
▶ Felt : Hey, hey! (0:18:12.03)
▶ Felt : What's your problem? (0:18:16.69)
▶ Felt : Why are you in such a hurry? (0:18:18.41)
▶ Felt : You're soaked with sweat. (0:18:23.80)
▶ Felt : Live strong. (0:18:26.66)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : Everyone in the slums says that. (0:18:28.68)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : Is it some kind of slogan? (0:18:31.16)
▶ Felt : Don't lump me in with those guys! (0:18:32.49)
▶ Felt : They're all talk. They aren't strong at all. (0:18:34.74)
▶ Felt : They're just a bunch of
stingy losers at life. (0:18:37.44)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : That's a bit harsh... (0:18:41.30)
▶ Felt : I'm not like the people here. (0:18:48.19)
▶ Felt : I have no intention of living out
my life in these back alleys! (0:18:50.88)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : And you think twenty holy coins will
make your dream come true? (0:18:55.99)
▶ Felt : It's true that it'd be a
huge leap toward my goal. (0:19:01.18)
▶ Felt : Even if I were alone, it isn't as
if I couldn't get by with effort. (0:19:04.43)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : If you were alone? (0:19:08.63)
▶ Felt : Never mind... (0:19:10.14)
▶ Felt : What are you smirking about? (0:19:18.25)
▶ Felt : You really piss me off! (0:19:20.39)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : Don't worry about it. (0:19:22.27)
▶ Felt : H-Hey, what're you doing? Stop! (0:19:24.14)
▶ Felt : Hey! (0:19:26.93)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : Just gotta make it work, huh? (0:19:27.93)
▶ Felt : I said, "Stop!" (0:19:28.83)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : And only I can do that. (0:19:30.34)
▶ Felt : Don't get all sentimental and babble nonsense! (0:19:31.84)
▶ Felt : I'll bite you! (0:19:35.21)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : It isn't only for her. (0:19:36.37)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : I'll change the fate that's waiting for me. (0:19:38.34)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : And to do that, I'll... (0:19:41.15)
▶ Felt : I told you to cut it out! (0:19:42.53)
▶ Rom : So this is a metia... (0:19:54.90)
▶ Rom : Even I've never seen one before. (0:19:56.82)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : It's fairly delicate, so handle it with care. (0:19:59.94)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : Think along the lines of, "If you
break it, you have to die," (0:20:03.45)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : like no do-overs. (0:20:07.01)
▶ Rom : Yeah, I'm definitely impressed. (0:20:09.03)
▶ Rom : If I were to sell this, I'd take no less than fifteen... no, twenty holy coins. (0:20:12.36)
▶ Rom : It's worth at least that. (0:20:19.56)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : All right! Negotiations complete! (0:20:21.43)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : Now, if we're done talking, let's go for
drinks to celebrate a completed sale! (0:20:24.88)
▶ Felt : Hold it! (0:20:30.85)
▶ Felt : Why are you in such a hurry? (0:20:33.30)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : Life doesn't last forever. (0:20:37.63)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : Make every second count. Don't waste any— (0:20:40.03)
▶ Felt : Yeah, yeah! (0:20:42.52)
▶ Felt : I don't care about all that. (0:20:43.36)
▶ Felt : Why do you even want the insignia, anyway? (0:20:45.13)
▶ Felt : This insignia is worth a lot more than it looks. (0:20:49.43)
▶ Felt : That's why everyone wants it. (0:20:54.59)
▶ Felt : In other words, this would sell
for more than a metia— (0:20:57.05)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : Hang on, Felt! That's a dangerous way to think! (0:21:00.48)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : He appraised it at over twenty holy coins. (0:21:03.62)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : Just sell it for that! Don't ask for more! (0:21:05.72)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : El— The woman who asked you for it
can't go higher than twenty, either. (0:21:09.23)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : She won't pay more than that! (0:21:13.59)
▶ Felt : How do you know that? (0:21:17.49)
▶ Felt : You just admitted that you're with them. (0:21:21.13)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : I don't have time... Please, Felt! (0:21:26.44)
▶ Felt : Begging won't help. (0:21:29.11)
▶ Felt : I acknowledge you as a negotiating party. (0:21:31.49)
▶ Felt : But not hearing what my client
says wouldn't be fair. (0:21:34.28)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : The reason I want that insignia (0:21:39.08)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : is so I can return it to its owner. (0:21:43.17)
▶ Felt : Huh? (0:21:45.64)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : I want to return it to its owner! (0:21:46.34)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : That's why I want the insignia! (0:21:49.05)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : That's all! So please! (0:21:50.74)
▶ Rom : Felt, it doesn't look to me like the boy's lying. (0:21:55.32)
▶ Felt : Don't get taken in by him. (0:22:00.36)
▶ Felt : He's obviously joking around. (0:22:02.42)
▶ Felt : Return it to the owner? Ridiculous! (0:22:04.26)
▶ Felt : If you're gonna lie, make it believable! (0:22:06.90)
▶ Felt : I won't be fooled! (0:22:09.13)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : Felt... (0:22:14.77)
▶ Rom : Who's that? (0:22:18.69)
▶ Felt : It might be for me. (0:22:19.81)
▶ Felt : It's a little early, though. (0:22:21.68)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : Don't open it! (0:22:29.48)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : W-We'll be killed! (0:22:31.29)
▶ Emilia : Kill you? I wouldn't do something so terrifying. (0:22:49.28)
▶ EXTRA : Reunion with the Witch (0:23:00.81)▶ Emilia : I'm glad you're here. (0:00:12.77)
▶ Emilia : This time, you won't get away. (0:00:14.67)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : Why is she here? It's still light out. (0:00:16.56)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : Wait, if she hadn't been with me,
would she have arrived this early? (0:00:20.45)
▶ Felt : You never quit, do you? (0:00:24.16)
▶ Felt : I'm telling you, just give up already! (0:00:26.62)
▶ Emilia : Sorry, but this is something I cannot give up on. (0:00:29.00)
▶ Emilia : If you do as I say, I won't hurt you. (0:00:31.60)
▶ Emilia : I have only one demand. Return my insignia. (0:00:43.12)
▶ Emilia : It's very important to me. (0:00:46.74)
▶ Rom : If she were just another magic
user, I wouldn't back down, (0:00:54.62)
▶ Rom : but this one's trouble... (0:00:58.70)
▶ Felt : What's with you, Old Man Rom? (0:01:00.48)
▶ Felt : Admitting defeat before we even fight?! (0:01:01.87)
▶ Rom : Young lady, you're an elf, ain't ya? (0:01:04.64)
▶ Emilia : Not exactly. (0:01:14.48)
▶ Emilia : I'm only a half-elf. (0:01:16.26)
▶ Felt : A half-elf? (0:01:18.90)
▶ Felt : And with silver hair... Wait, are you... (0:01:20.50)
▶ Emilia : It's an accidental resemblance!
Really, it's bothersome to me. (0:01:22.62)
▶ Felt : You set me up, didn't you? (0:01:27.48)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : Huh? No, I didn't do anything... (0:01:30.00)
▶ Felt : After you said you'd return it to its owner,
I thought you were suspicious! (0:01:32.30)
▶ Emilia : What do you mean? You two aren't working together? (0:01:36.69)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : Her nature never changes, no matter how
many times I start over in this world. (0:01:50.11)
▶ Felt : Hey! What are you laughing about?! (0:01:56.72)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : Come on, isn't that enough? Return her insignia. (0:01:59.17)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : And, Sat— you, hurry and get out of here. (0:02:02.88)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : Try not to let anyone steal it again. (0:02:06.06)
▶ Emilia : Why are you suddenly being so nice? (0:02:07.98)
▶ Emilia : I don't understand at all. (0:02:10.47)
▶ Felt : I don't understand you, either! (0:02:12.76)
▶ Felt : What's up with you? (0:02:15.46)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : Puck! Shield her! (0:02:18.48)
▶ Puck : That was a bit closer than I expected. (0:02:24.22)
▶ Puck : You saved us! (0:02:27.83)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : Nice one, Puck! (0:02:29.13)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : Thank goodness it was before five,
while you're still on duty. (0:02:30.33)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : Thanks! (0:02:33.12)
▶ Elsa Granhiert : A spirit... That is a spirit, yes? (0:02:35.04)
▶ Elsa Granhiert : How wonderful. (0:02:39.15)
▶ Elsa Granhiert : I have never dissected a spirit's stomach before. (0:02:40.62)
▶ Felt : Hey, what do you mean by that? (0:02:47.58)
▶ Elsa Granhiert : We can hardly negotiate, if the
item's original owner is here. (0:02:50.17)
▶ Elsa Granhiert : So I have changed my plans. (0:02:54.57)
▶ Elsa Granhiert : I shall slaughter everyone here. (0:02:56.86)
▶ Elsa Granhiert : You failed to see your job through to the end. (0:02:59.57)
▶ Elsa Granhiert : You talk a good game, but you do terrible work. (0:03:02.50)
▶ Elsa Granhiert : You really are just another slum dweller. (0:03:06.13)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : You bitch... (0:03:10.87)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : Cut the crap! (0:03:12.48)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : Don't get your kicks from picking on a little kid! (0:03:13.98)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : You guts-loving sadist! (0:03:16.80)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : Felt is doing her best to live strong... (0:03:19.14)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : Just because your plan was thrown off,
you think it's over and flip tables? (0:03:21.62)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : Are you a little kid?! (0:03:24.46)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : You should value life more! (0:03:25.57)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : Do you know how much having
your belly cut open hurts? (0:03:27.11)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : Well, I do! (0:03:29.48)
▶ Elsa Granhiert : What are you talking about? (0:03:31.49)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : I'm in the process of letting the justice
and chivalry I never knew I had (0:03:33.56)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : denounce all the world's unfairness! (0:03:36.68)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : And what I consider "unfair" is you,
this situation, and... (0:03:38.91)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : Stay tuned, folks. (0:03:42.13)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : There! (0:03:43.65)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : All done buying time... (0:03:44.77)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : Get her, Puck! (0:03:46.81)
▶ Puck : A brilliant display of awkwardness, which I
hope survives through the ages. (0:03:48.56)
▶ Puck : I'd better live up to your expectations! (0:03:51.64)
▶ Puck : We haven't introduced ourselves, have we? (0:03:53.12)
▶ Puck : My name's Puck. (0:03:56.85)
▶ Puck : Remember my name (0:03:58.40)
▶ Puck : after you die! (0:03:59.94)
▶ Rom : Did they get 'er?! (0:04:05.78)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : Don't trigger that flag, old man! (0:04:06.87)
▶ Elsa Granhiert : One should always be prepared. (0:04:13.44)
▶ Emilia : Don't underestimate a user of the spiritual arts. (0:04:21.83)
▶ Puck : For a girl, you're well accustomed to battle. (0:04:28.15)
▶ Elsa Granhiert : My, it's been a while since I was
regarded as a simple girl. (0:04:31.02)
▶ Puck : Well, from my perspective, all opponents
are basically babies. (0:04:35.29)
▶ Puck : Still, you're so strong, I almost pity you. (0:04:39.08)
▶ Elsa Granhiert : I'm deeply touched to be praised by a spirit. (0:04:42.48)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : If this turns into a battle of attrition,
we should have a chance. (0:04:48.25)
▶ Rom : No, fer a spirit, the real battle is how
long they can stay corporeal. (0:04:52.12)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : That's right, it must be almost five... (0:04:56.37)
▶ Elsa Granhiert : Oh, and just when we were having
such fun. What a bore. (0:04:59.16)
▶ Puck : That's what sucks about being a ladies' man. (0:05:02.48)
▶ Puck : The girls just won't let you sleep. (0:05:04.87)
▶ Puck : But you know, staying up late is bad for
your skin, so we should wrap this up! (0:05:07.62)
▶ Puck : I wasn't just randomly throwing those around. (0:05:17.26)
▶ Elsa Granhiert : Does this mean I've been had? (0:05:20.40)
▶ Puck : Goodnight! (0:05:22.36)
▶ Elsa Granhiert : My, how lovely... (0:05:35.31)
▶ Elsa Granhiert : I thought I was going to die. (0:05:38.49)
▶ Puck : But you're a girl, so I don't find that
sort of thing very impressive. (0:05:43.15)
▶ Emilia : Puck, can you keep going? (0:05:47.18)
▶ Puck : Sorry, I'm really sleepy... (0:05:48.91)
▶ Puck : I underestimated her a bit... (0:05:51.44)
▶ Puck : My mana's gone, so I have to disappear. (0:05:53.67)
▶ Emilia : I'll take care of things here,
so you can rest. Thank you. (0:05:55.40)
▶ Puck : If anything happens to you, I'll act
according to my contract. (0:06:00.52)
▶ Puck : If it comes to it, call me, even if you
have to squeeze me out of my odo. (0:06:04.37)
▶ Elsa Granhiert : You're going away? (0:06:10.51)
▶ Elsa Granhiert : Well, that is very unfortunate. (0:06:19.40)
▶ Rom : We can't keep just sitting around, watchin', Felt. (0:06:35.64)
▶ Felt : Yeah, I know. (0:06:40.12)
▶ Felt : If we're going to run, we should get moving now. (0:06:42.08)
▶ Felt : About before, well... (0:06:45.44)
▶ Felt : I guess you kinda saved me. (0:06:47.57)
▶ Felt : But just a little. (0:06:50.70)
▶ Felt : Also, don't call me a little kid! (0:06:52.31)
▶ Felt : I'm fifteen, you know! (0:06:54.95)
▶ Felt : That can't be much younger than you! (0:06:56.93)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : I'll be eighteen this year... (0:06:59.35)
▶ Felt : No way! You're totally a kid! (0:07:01.93)
▶ Felt : You need to live a life that
shows on your face more! (0:07:03.59)
▶ Rom : Here I come! (0:07:16.08)
▶ Elsa Granhiert : Ah, but isn't it a bit boorish to cut in on a dance? (0:07:17.73)
▶ Rom : If you wanna dance, I'll show you the
best dancin' you've ever seen! (0:07:21.11)
▶ Rom : Here we go... Round an' round! (0:07:29.84)
▶ Rom : Eh? What in the— (0:07:37.99)
▶ Elsa Granhiert : You're so strong, I was able to do this. (0:07:43.67)
▶ Felt : Not gonna happen! (0:07:46.52)
▶ Felt : Old Man Rom! (0:07:51.13)
▶ Elsa Granhiert : You bad girl... (0:07:57.22)
▶ Elsa Granhiert : You have neither the resolve nor strength to fight. (0:08:00.74)
▶ Elsa Granhiert : You should have at least stayed in the
corner, making yourself small... (0:08:03.34)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : Damn, we're done for...
There's really nothing I can do. (0:08:07.17)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : I guess I'll have to Return by Death and start over. (0:08:10.48)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : No, I don't want to feel that pain again. (0:08:16.14)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : I don't wanna die... (0:08:20.17)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : I guess, as long as I have life, (0:08:23.09)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : all I can do is fight with all my might. (0:08:25.73)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : Haidara! (0:08:35.37)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : Are you okay? (0:08:46.11)
▶ Felt : Why did you... (0:08:48.06)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : Listen to me, Felt. I'm going to buy us time. (0:08:49.46)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : I'll give you an opening somehow.
So when I do, run as fast as you can! (0:08:53.47)
▶ Felt : What? You're telling me to tuck my
tail between my legs and run?! (0:08:57.28)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : Yes... Stick out your butt,
tuck in your tail, and run. (0:09:00.31)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : You're fifteen, and I'm eighteen. (0:09:03.49)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : That means you're probably
the youngest one here. (0:09:05.73)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : So it's a given we'd pick the method
most likely to keep you alive. (0:09:08.76)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : It's a given! (0:09:12.12)
▶ Felt : Give me a break. A minute ago,
you were cowering in fear! (0:09:13.12)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : That was then. This is now. (0:09:16.64)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : I'm not cowering now, so it's fine. (0:09:19.07)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : Take this! (0:09:26.53)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : Now! Go, Felt! (0:09:31.05)
▶ Elsa Granhiert : You think I'll let her go? (0:09:37.01)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : Whoa, I'm awesome! (0:09:42.50)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : But that hurt the tips of my toes
more than I expected. (0:09:43.84)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : You let one get away... (0:09:56.56)
▶ Elsa Granhiert : For once, I did feel a tiny bit annoyed. (0:09:59.18)
▶ Emilia : Don't forget about me. (0:10:02.43)
▶ Elsa Granhiert : I've grown quite tired of that game by now. (0:10:07.38)
▶ Elsa Granhiert : Do you think you can still keep me amused? (0:10:10.91)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : If you've got some hidden true power, (0:10:13.29)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : now would be a good time to use it. (0:10:15.84)
▶ Emilia : I do have a trump card. (0:10:18.84)
▶ Emilia : But if I use it, I'll be the only one left standing. (0:10:20.30)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : No exploding yourself, please... (0:10:23.02)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : Don't do anything hasty, okay? (0:10:24.71)
▶ Emilia : I won't use it. (0:10:26.63)
▶ Emilia : Not when you're still here, (0:10:28.20)
▶ Emilia : doing your best. (0:10:32.03)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : Just now, I didn't see anything... (0:10:42.74)
▶ Emilia : Huh? (0:10:45.49)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : None of that whole conversation ever happened! (0:10:46.21)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : I finally remembered why I'm here, to begin with. (0:10:49.36)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : I'll kill you, you shitbag! (0:10:52.87)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : I won't let you play your trump card! (0:10:55.32)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : I'll blow you away and get (0:10:57.90)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : a happy ending! (0:11:02.81)
▶ Elsa Granhiert : It looks like you have a bit too much energy. (0:11:06.52)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : You black widow! (0:11:09.18)
▶ Elsa Granhiert : Well, there's no doubt you'll be
the first caught in my web. (0:11:10.67)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : Nice cover! (0:11:16.61)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : Ouch, damn it! How do you like this?! (0:11:22.70)
▶ Elsa Granhiert : I caught you. (0:11:28.12)
▶ Reinhard van Astrea : That's enough. (0:11:36.27)
▶ Reinhard van Astrea : It looks like that was a close call, (0:11:49.68)
▶ Reinhard van Astrea : but I'm glad I made it in time. (0:11:51.85)
▶ Reinhard van Astrea : Now... (0:11:54.32)
▶ Elsa Granhiert : You're... (0:11:55.71)
▶ Reinhard van Astrea : Shall we put an end to this? (0:11:59.57)
▶ Felt : Someone! (0:12:06.15)
▶ Felt : Anyone! Is anyone here?! (0:12:08.00)
▶ Felt : Damn it! Please... Please, someone... (0:12:13.30)
▶ Felt : Someone help! (0:12:18.94)
▶ Reinhard van Astrea : Very well. (0:12:25.34)
▶ Reinhard van Astrea : I'll help. (0:12:29.99)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : Reinhard? (0:12:35.80)
▶ Reinhard van Astrea : That's right, Subaru. (0:12:38.51)
▶ Reinhard van Astrea : We meet again. Sorry I'm late. (0:12:40.08)
▶ Reinhard van Astrea : Black hair, black clothes, (0:12:43.62)
▶ Reinhard van Astrea : and a blade unique to the northern provinces. (0:12:45.49)
▶ Reinhard van Astrea : There is no mistaking those characteristics. (0:12:48.09)
▶ Reinhard van Astrea : You are the Bowel Hunter. (0:12:51.12)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : What kind of evil nickname is that? (0:12:53.20)
▶ Reinhard van Astrea : It was derived from her unique killing style. (0:12:56.40)
▶ Reinhard van Astrea : Her name is known, even in the capital,
as that of a dangerous individual. (0:13:00.07)
▶ Elsa Granhiert : Reinhard... Yes, a knight among knights, (0:13:03.65)
▶ Elsa Granhiert : born to a line of master swordsmen, correct? (0:13:07.71)
▶ Elsa Granhiert : How remarkable, having all my
opponents be so much fun. (0:13:09.36)
▶ Reinhard van Astrea : There are many things I'd like to ask you. (0:13:13.26)
▶ Reinhard van Astrea : I strongly suggest you surrender. (0:13:15.36)
▶ Elsa Granhiert : You expect a starving predator to
resist such choice, juicy prey? (0:13:17.67)
▶ Reinhard van Astrea : Subaru, stand back a bit. (0:13:24.86)
▶ Reinhard van Astrea : If you could stand next to her, I'd appreciate it. (0:13:27.20)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : You got it. (0:13:29.64)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : That woman is like a monster,
so don't lower your guard... (0:13:31.30)
▶ Reinhard van Astrea : As luck would have it, (0:13:34.08)
▶ Reinhard van Astrea : hunting monsters happens to be my specialty. (0:13:35.93)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : Old Man Rom is still alive? (0:13:43.48)
▶ Emilia : He isn't out of the woods yet.
I have to heal him now. (0:13:45.52)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : You really want to? He's part of the
gang that stole your insignia. (0:13:49.11)
▶ Emilia : That's why. (0:13:53.27)
▶ Emilia : I need him to recover, so he'll repay
the favor by giving me information. (0:13:54.61)
▶ Emilia : He wouldn't lie to the one who saved his life. (0:13:58.73)
▶ Emilia : This is as much for my own sake. (0:14:02.34)
▶ Reinhard van Astrea : I would rather not use violence on a woman. (0:14:06.93)
▶ Elsa Granhiert : Just as the rumors say... No, (0:14:15.32)
▶ Elsa Granhiert : you are even better. (0:14:17.47)
▶ Reinhard van Astrea : I'm not sure I'll meet your expectations. (0:14:20.79)
▶ Elsa Granhiert : Aren't you going to use that sword at your hip? (0:14:22.92)
▶ Elsa Granhiert : I would love to experience its legendary sharpness. (0:14:25.60)
▶ Reinhard van Astrea : This sword can only be drawn when needed. (0:14:29.24)
▶ Reinhard van Astrea : The fact that it hasn't left its sheath (0:14:32.64)
▶ Reinhard van Astrea : means this is not one of those times. (0:14:35.20)
▶ Elsa Granhiert : I do believe I've been underestimated. (0:14:37.24)
▶ Reinhard van Astrea : Well, it's an upsetting judgment for me, as well. (0:14:39.49)
▶ Reinhard van Astrea : Therefore, (0:14:42.99)
▶ Reinhard van Astrea : I shall take you on with this instead. (0:14:44.51)
▶ Reinhard van Astrea : Do you object? (0:14:49.21)
▶ Elsa Granhiert : No, it is wonderful. Wonderful! (0:14:50.32)
▶ Elsa Granhiert : Do entertain me, please. (0:14:53.70)
▶ Reinhard van Astrea : If you've lost your weapon,
I strongly suggest you surrender. (0:15:01.50)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : She's got a second one, Reinhard! (0:15:06.20)
▶ Elsa Granhiert : I'm impressed you knew. (0:15:11.77)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : Well, I've personally experienced it... (0:15:13.17)
▶ Elsa Granhiert : But I don't have merely two fangs. (0:15:15.63)
▶ Elsa Granhiert : Would you mind if we start again? (0:15:18.67)
▶ Reinhard van Astrea : If I divest you of all your weapons,
will you be satisfied? (0:15:21.14)
▶ Elsa Granhiert : If I lose my fangs, I'll use my claws. (0:15:24.73)
▶ Elsa Granhiert : If I lose my claws, I'll use my bones. (0:15:27.11)
▶ Elsa Granhiert : And if I lose my bones, I'll use my life. (0:15:29.19)
▶ Elsa Granhiert : That is how a "Bowel Hunter" fights. (0:15:31.62)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : Surely Reinhard won't fail to land
the decisive blow, will he? (0:15:35.31)
▶ Emilia : Because I'm using my spiritual arts,
he cannot fight at full strength. (0:15:40.16)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : What do those have to do with each other? (0:15:44.66)
▶ Emilia : If Reinhard were truly intent on fighting, (0:15:46.24)
▶ Emilia : all the mana in the atmosphere
would turn away from me. (0:15:48.87)
▶ Emilia : I'm almost done healing him. (0:15:52.64)
▶ Emilia : When I give the signal, let him know. (0:15:54.48)
▶ Emilia : Now he's all right. Go ahead. (0:16:02.45)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : Reinhard! I don't really get it, but do your thing! (0:16:04.40)
▶ Elsa Granhiert : What will you show me? (0:16:09.85)
▶ Reinhard van Astrea : The swordplay of the Astrea family. (0:16:12.06)
▶ Elsa Granhiert : The Bowel Hunter, Elsa Granhiert. (0:16:20.68)
▶ Reinhard van Astrea : Reinhard van Astrea, of the
line of master swordsmen. (0:16:24.87)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : Whoa, whoa, whoa! (0:16:50.16)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : Hunting monsters is your specialty, my ass! (0:17:05.55)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : You're a monster yourself! (0:17:08.62)
▶ Reinhard van Astrea : Even I'm a bit hurt by a comment
like that, Subaru. (0:17:11.28)
▶ Reinhard van Astrea : I'm sorry I asked too much of you. (0:17:16.60)
▶ Reinhard van Astrea : Rest well now. (0:17:18.88)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : There isn't a shadow left, let alone a body... (0:17:20.89)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : This is all that's left after just a sword swing? (0:17:23.69)
▶ Emilia : It's over now? (0:17:26.30)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : Yeah, somehow or other. Literally. (0:17:27.76)
▶ Emilia : Why are you staring at me? That's quite rude. (0:17:31.81)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : It's just, you still have your arms
and legs, even your head... (0:17:35.92)
▶ Emilia : Of course I do. Don't say such scary things. (0:17:40.34)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : Yeah, you're right. It's obvious, huh? (0:17:43.95)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : I still have my arms, too. (0:17:46.55)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : And there's no knife in my back
or gaping hole in my gut. (0:17:48.19)
▶ Emilia : You talk as if you've experienced
those things before. (0:17:52.41)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : There was a time when I did. (0:17:56.31)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : Oh, yeah, Reinhard... I haven't thanked you yet. (0:17:58.73)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : You saved my ass! (0:18:01.59)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : Back in the alley, too. (0:18:03.03)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : I guess you heard my heart's cries for help, friend! (0:18:04.75)
▶ Reinhard van Astrea : If I did do that, I'd certainly be proud... (0:18:07.70)
▶ Reinhard van Astrea : Friend. (0:18:10.96)
▶ Reinhard van Astrea : She was desperately running around the streets, (0:18:12.75)
▶ Reinhard van Astrea : and she asked for my help. (0:18:15.79)
▶ Emilia : That's... (0:18:18.71)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : Now, hang on... (0:18:20.10)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : If she hadn't brought Reinhard,
we'd have been destroyed. (0:18:21.75)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : Just take a look at this face, and spare
me the ice-statue punishment, okay? (0:18:25.72)
▶ Emilia : I wouldn't do anything so violent! (0:18:29.87)
▶ Emilia : And what does your face have to do with— (0:18:31.77)
▶ Reinhard van Astrea : Subaru! (0:18:34.59)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : She'll go for the gut! (0:18:44.77)
▶ Elsa Granhiert : He got in my way again. (0:18:50.65)
▶ Reinhard van Astrea : That's enough, Elsa! (0:18:52.18)
▶ Elsa Granhiert : Soon enough, I'll disembowel everyone here. (0:18:57.16)
▶ Elsa Granhiert : Till then, take good care of your bowels. (0:19:03.28)
▶ Reinhard van Astrea : Are you all right? (0:19:08.40)
▶ Emilia : Whether I'm all right doesn't
matter! More importantly, (0:19:10.44)
▶ Emilia : are you all right? That was far too reckless! (0:19:13.68)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : Ow... (0:19:14.06)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : Oh, it was no problem. (0:19:16.77)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : I sure took the long road, but I
finally reached this point. (0:19:19.40)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : My name is Natsuki Subaru! (0:19:24.83)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : And I just saved your life from a heinous villain! (0:19:27.03)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : Are we OK on that? (0:19:30.94)
▶ Emilia : "OK"? (0:19:33.28)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : It means "Are we clear on that?" So... (0:19:34.64)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : OK? (0:19:36.96)
▶ Emilia : O-OK... (0:19:38.58)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : I, your rescuer, saved your life. (0:19:40.34)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : And you are the heroine I saved! (0:19:42.58)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : So wouldn't that mean you should
repay me in kind? Wouldn't it? (0:19:44.95)
▶ Emilia : All right, I get it. (0:19:48.90)
▶ Emilia : Only if it's within my power, of course. (0:19:50.51)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : In that case, I have only one request! (0:19:53.81)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : Yes, my request is... (0:19:57.97)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : Tell me your name. (0:20:05.90)
▶ Emilia : Emilia. (0:20:11.15)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : Huh? (0:20:12.16)
▶ Emilia : My name is Emilia. Just Emilia. (0:20:14.62)
▶ Emilia : Thank you, Subaru. For saving me. (0:20:18.83)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : All those times I got hurt, all the crying I did, (0:20:27.54)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : all the pain I felt, all the fighting
I did with my life at stake... (0:20:30.62)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : And my reward was her name and a single smile. (0:20:35.21)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : Jeez... (0:20:39.52)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : Talk about unequal compensation. (0:20:41.81)
▶ Reinhard van Astrea : Anyway, Subaru, I'm impressed that you're unhurt. (0:20:48.04)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : That thing protected me just in time. (0:20:50.93)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : If not for that, I'd be in two pieces right now. (0:20:53.59)
▶ Reinhard van Astrea : True, if not for this... (0:20:56.48)
▶ Reinhard van Astrea : Eh? (0:20:59.47)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : Uh-oh. I should have seen this coming. (0:21:04.59)
▶ Emilia : Subaru? (0:21:09.56)
▶ Emilia : Subaru! (0:21:11.41)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : Man... (0:21:15.70)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : She's so cute when she's panicking... (0:21:17.47)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : A parallel world fantasy... (0:21:21.44)
▶ Emilia : There. His treatment is complete. (0:21:27.34)
▶ Emilia : He should be over the hump now. (0:21:29.52)
▶ Reinhard van Astrea : By the way, Lady Emilia, what is
your relation to Subaru? (0:21:31.41)
▶ Emilia : A passing acquaintance? (0:21:37.51)
▶ Emilia : I don't recall ever meeting him before. (0:21:39.96)
▶ Emilia : I thought our meeting, earlier today, was the first. (0:21:42.82)
▶ Reinhard van Astrea : But he was looking for you. (0:21:46.24)
▶ Reinhard van Astrea : He said he had something to give you. (0:21:49.19)
▶ Emilia : That's why it's so strange... (0:21:51.26)
▶ Reinhard van Astrea : What shall we do with him? (0:21:53.66)
▶ Reinhard van Astrea : I would be glad to take him home as a guest. (0:21:55.90)
▶ Emilia : No, I'll take him home with me. (0:21:59.33)
▶ Emilia : That way, I can learn what's really going on. (0:22:02.27)
▶ Emilia : But more importantly, what will become
of that girl and the old man? (0:22:05.30)
▶ Reinhard van Astrea : Officially, I cannot overlook what they've done. (0:22:09.85)
▶ Reinhard van Astrea : But... (0:22:14.29)
▶ Reinhard van Astrea : Unfortunately, I'm off duty today. (0:22:15.92)
▶ Emilia : You're a bad knight. (0:22:20.32)
▶ Emilia : Is this old man your family? (0:22:25.46)
▶ Felt : Something like that.
Old Man Rom is the only one I have... (0:22:28.93)
▶ Felt : I guess he's like my grandpa. (0:22:34.99)
▶ Emilia : I see. I only have one family member, too. (0:22:37.27)
▶ Emilia : But he's always asleep at the
most important moments. (0:22:41.24)
▶ Emilia : When he's awake, I'd never say that aloud. (0:22:43.92)
▶ Felt : I thought you'd be a lot harsher to me. (0:22:47.92)
▶ Felt : I'm sorry. (0:22:50.67)
▶ Felt : You saved my life, and I can't let a debt go unpaid. (0:22:52.59)
▶ Felt : I'll return what I stole. (0:22:56.31)
▶ Felt : If it's important, keep it hidden,
so no one can steal it again! (0:22:58.72)
▶ Emilia : It feels funny, having you give me that warning. (0:23:02.22)
▶ Emilia : Reinhard? (0:23:10.23)
▶ Felt : You're hurting me! Let go! (0:23:11.98)
▶ Reinhard van Astrea : How can this be? (0:23:15.58)
▶ Reinhard van Astrea : What is your name? (0:23:16.93)
▶ Felt : Huh? It's Felt... (0:23:18.09)
▶ Reinhard van Astrea : And your family name? How old are you? (0:23:20.16)
▶ Felt : I don't have anything fancy like a family name! (0:23:22.89)
▶ Felt : I'm... about fifteen, I think. (0:23:26.09)
▶ Felt : I don't know my birthday. (0:23:28.93)
▶ Felt : Look, just let me go! (0:23:30.53)
▶ Reinhard van Astrea : Lady Emilia, I am afraid I cannot
keep my promise to you. (0:23:31.99)
▶ Reinhard van Astrea : I shall be taking this girl with me. (0:23:36.14)
▶ Felt : May I ask why? If it's for stealing my insignia... (0:23:39.17)
▶ Reinhard van Astrea : That is, indeed, no small crime. (0:23:43.42)
▶ Reinhard van Astrea : But compared to the gravity of overlooking
the crime unfolding before me, it's trivial. (0:23:46.29)
▶ Reinhard van Astrea : I need you to come with me. (0:23:52.51)
▶ Reinhard van Astrea : I'm sorry, but I cannot allow you to refuse. (0:23:54.09)
▶ Felt : Get over yourself! Just because you saved me— (0:23:56.22)
▶ Emilia : That wasn't very courtly, either. (0:24:01.25)
▶ Reinhard van Astrea : I was careful not to use too much. (0:24:03.85)
▶ Reinhard van Astrea : Lady Emilia, I will be calling
upon you soon, most likely. (0:24:05.84)
▶ Reinhard van Astrea : I hope you understand. (0:24:10.80)
▶ Reinhard van Astrea : Please take good care of Subaru. (0:24:13.48)
▶ Reinhard van Astrea : Today may be the last chance we
have to gaze calmly at the moon. (0:24:23.31)
▶ EXTRA : Starting Life from Zero in World (0:24:32.74)▶ Subaru Natsuki : I don't know this ceiling. (0:00:18.58)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : The wound on my stomach is gone... (0:00:25.96)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : Everything considered, it must've been her. (0:00:29.12)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : Emilia's healing power, huh? (0:00:31.50)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : Well, at any rate, seems I got out of
using Return by Death this time... (0:00:45.78)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : But normally, wouldn't you wake up to a girl (0:00:51.22)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : by your bed asking, "Are you awake,"
after she'd cared for you all this time? (0:00:54.18)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : For a story about being summoned to
another world, it's kinda flawed. (0:00:58.80)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : A looping hallway... (0:01:10.36)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : One of those things where I can't
leave until I find the right room? (0:01:12.37)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : The typical pattern says that the
first door is likely to be it! (0:01:15.66)
▶ Beatrice : What a profoundly aggravating
man you are, I suppose. (0:01:21.48)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : First NPC found! (0:01:25.21)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : With that cold attitude, you're gonna
ruin your cute face. (0:01:27.04)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : Come on, smile... Smile. (0:01:30.76)
▶ Beatrice : A derisive sneer is the only smile worth giving you. (0:01:32.32)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : Are you mad because I guessed
correctly on the first try? (0:01:35.81)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : I've always been a pretty lucky guesser... (0:01:39.03)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : I can understand why game masters would
want me in all the events, but sorry! (0:01:41.58)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : So, what is this place, anyway? (0:01:47.02)
▶ Beatrice : Hmph, it's Betty's multi-purpose room,
both library and bedroom, I suppose. (0:01:49.90)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : Talk about your token response. (0:01:54.01)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : Are you one of the manual girls everyone's into now? (0:01:55.92)
▶ Beatrice : Betty's had just about enough. (0:01:58.18)
▶ Beatrice : Time to teach you a lesson, I suppose. (0:02:00.86)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : Hey, what are you gonna do? (0:02:03.35)
▶ Beatrice : Don't you dare move. (0:02:05.80)
▶ Beatrice : Anything you'd like to say? (0:02:08.38)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : D-Don't hurt me. (0:02:10.14)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : What did you do to me, you drill loli? (0:02:22.00)
▶ Beatrice : I only collected the mana from your body, I suppose. (0:02:24.66)
▶ Beatrice : It confirmed that you are not an enemy. (0:02:28.24)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : You're not human, are you? (0:02:31.40)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : And I don't mean your personality... (0:02:34.18)
▶ Beatrice : It took you long enough to notice, I suppose. (0:02:36.80)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : I take it back... Your personality isn't human, either. (0:02:38.74)
▶ Beatrice : Do not measure a proud, noble being
by your standards, human. (0:02:41.93)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : I know that ceiling. (0:04:24.79)
▶ Rem : Oh, he has awakened, Sister. (0:04:27.02)
▶ Ram : Indeed, he has awakened, Rem. (0:04:29.32)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : I, a denizen of the night, waking in the morning? (0:04:31.68)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : I'm getting all emotional... (0:04:34.90)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : I'd better go to sleep a second time. (0:04:36.69)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : No, I woke up earlier, so this'll be the third. (0:04:38.16)
▶ Rem : My, what a deadbeat thing to say. (0:04:42.64)
▶ Rem : Did you hear that, Sister? (0:04:44.81)
▶ Ram : Yes, truly a loser's words. I heard him, Rem. (0:04:46.16)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : All right! (0:04:49.00)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : Who are these two voices that
keep criticizing me in stereo?! (0:04:49.99)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : N-No way... (0:04:54.31)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : Maid costumes exist in this world, too? (0:04:55.70)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : In my mind, maids were always the
very personification of elegance! (0:04:58.96)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : This ain't so bad, either! (0:05:03.70)
▶ Rem : How terrible. You are being violated
in our guest's mind, Sister. (0:05:05.51)
▶ Ram : It is terrible. You are experiencing the ultimate
shame in our guest's mind, Rem. (0:05:10.65)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : Don't underestimate my capacity. (0:05:15.42)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : You're both fair prey in my fantasies... (0:05:17.55)
▶ Emilia : Can't you wake up more peacefully, Subaru? (0:05:22.50)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : Whoever picked that outfit totally gets it! (0:05:31.61)
▶ Emilia : I don't know what you're talking about, (0:05:34.71)
▶ Emilia : but the fact that I know it's something
stupid is disappointing. (0:05:36.85)
▶ Rem : Listen to this, Miss Emilia. (0:05:39.84)
▶ Rem : My dear sister was just violated by that man. (0:05:41.55)
▶ Ram : Please listen to this, Miss Emilia. (0:05:44.48)
▶ Ram : Rem was held prisoner and shamed by that man. (0:05:45.95)
▶ Emilia : And you two, don't tease him too much. (0:05:48.58)
▶ Rem : Yes, Miss Emilia. My sister is very sorry. (0:05:50.98)
▶ Ram : Yes, Miss Emilia. Rem is sorry, as well. (0:05:53.60)
▶ Emilia : Subaru, are you feeling all right? (0:05:56.18)
▶ Emilia : Does anything feel off? (0:05:58.92)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : Huh? Oh, I'm just a little groggy from oversleeping. (0:06:00.38)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : You saved me, didn't you, Emilia-tan? (0:06:04.22)
▶ Emilia : Huh? "Tan"? (0:06:06.66)
▶ Emilia : What does "tan" mean? (0:06:08.24)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : Uh, you can just ignore that one. (0:06:09.56)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : Seriously, though, thanks. You saved me. (0:06:12.27)
▶ Emilia : No, I'm the one who should thank you. (0:06:15.10)
▶ Emilia : You barely know me, but you
risked your life to save me. (0:06:18.55)
▶ Emilia : It's natural I would heal your wounds afterward. (0:06:22.94)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : Then, once again, (0:06:28.09)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : I guess it's time to start a new day! (0:06:29.83)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : This place really is huge... (0:06:34.41)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : The yard isn't so much a yard as a field. (0:06:36.94)
▶ Emilia : Those are unusual movements.
What are you doing? (0:06:40.86)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : My homeland's ancient practice
of warm-up exercises. (0:06:43.63)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : Come on, Emilia-tan! Join me! (0:06:47.22)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : Radio calisthenics, number 2... (0:06:49.56)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : Bounce on both feet to loosen up your body! (0:06:51.10)
▶ Emilia : Huh? You're kidding! What is that? (0:06:54.18)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : Just do what I do. (0:06:56.70)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : I'll drill the essence of radio calisthenics into you! (0:06:58.60)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : Now, raise both arms and shout, "Victory!" (0:07:06.72)
▶ Emilia : V-Victory! (0:07:10.22)
▶ Puck : Victory! Victory! (0:07:11.94)
▶ Puck : Victory! (0:07:14.16)
▶ Puck : Hi, Subaru! Great morning, isn't it? (0:07:16.00)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : Well, since the wee hours of the morning,
it's been nothing but chaos for me. (0:07:19.03)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : Looping hallways and a mean
little girl on a rampage... (0:07:23.46)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : And then, shedding the sweat
of passion with Emilia-tan. (0:07:26.76)
▶ Emilia : Don't make it sound so scandalous! (0:07:30.20)
▶ Emilia : Good morning, Puck. (0:07:33.02)
▶ Emilia : Sorry I put you through so much yesterday. (0:07:34.35)
▶ Puck : Morning, Lia. I almost lost you yesterday. (0:07:36.64)
▶ Puck : I can never thank Subaru enough. (0:07:40.92)
▶ Puck : I must do something for him. (0:07:43.67)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : Okay, then... (0:07:45.26)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : Let me pet your fur whenever I want! (0:07:46.49)
▶ Emilia : Huh? That's all? (0:07:49.02)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : For a first-rate fur master such as myself, (0:07:51.50)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : being able to love on the object of
your petting affections anytime (0:07:54.24)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : is worth as much as a multimillionaire's riches! (0:07:57.70)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : Oh, man, these ears... (0:08:01.54)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : I'm in love with how soft you are. (0:08:03.91)
▶ Puck : Since I can kind of read your mind,
I know you feel that way, (0:08:06.54)
▶ Puck : but I'm amazed you can say it! (0:08:08.97)
▶ Puck : It's okay, Lia. (0:08:11.76)
▶ Puck : I can't find any malice, hostility, or ill-intent in Subaru. (0:08:13.27)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : It's so cute how you call her "Lia," too. (0:08:16.72)
▶ Puck : Not as cute as your "Emilia-tan"! (0:08:19.34)
▶ Emilia : You really are strange, Subaru. (0:08:22.20)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : Huh? (0:08:24.56)
▶ Emilia : Oh? What brings you two here? (0:08:31.46)
▶ Rem : Miss Emilia... (0:08:34.60)
▶ Ram : Miss Emilia... (0:08:34.60)
▶ Ram : Our lord, Master Roswaal, has returned. (0:08:35.79)
▶ Rem : Our lord, Master Roswaal, has returned. (0:08:35.79)
▶ Rem : Please come inside. (0:08:39.58)
▶ Ram : Please come inside. (0:08:39.58)
▶ Beatrice : I was watching you from upstairs,
and you know what? (0:08:45.06)
▶ Beatrice : It would seem you are quite dumb, I suppose. (0:08:48.13)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : Where do you get off saying that, you loli?! (0:08:50.74)
▶ Beatrice : What does that word mean? (0:08:53.24)
▶ Beatrice : I have never heard it before, and it irritates me. (0:08:55.00)
▶ Puck : Hey, Betty. Haven't seen you in four days. (0:08:58.03)
▶ Puck : Have you been doing well and staying ladylike? (0:08:59.91)
▶ Beatrice : Bubby! (0:09:02.62)
▶ Beatrice : I've been waiting for you to come home. (0:09:04.76)
▶ Beatrice : Will you stay with me today, do you suppose? (0:09:07.47)
▶ Puck : Sure, no problem. (0:09:09.61)
▶ Puck : Let's finally relax together today. (0:09:11.28)
▶ Beatrice : Yay! (0:09:13.49)
▶ Emilia : Bewildered, aren't you? (0:09:16.78)
▶ Emilia : Beatrice is so taken with Puck. (0:09:18.34)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : Who even says "bewildered" nowadays? (0:09:20.56)
▶ Roswaal L. Mathers : My, my! How unusual to see you here, Beatrice... (0:09:24.05)
▶ Roswaal L. Mathers : I'm so happy you've decided to dine with me. (0:09:27.63)
▶ Beatrice : That boy is more than enough of an
addle-brained fool for me, I suppose. (0:09:33.00)
▶ Beatrice : Betty was only waiting for Bubby! (0:09:36.58)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : You guys hired a clown to entertain
you before each meal? (0:09:39.30)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : I'll never understand how rich folks think. (0:09:43.06)
▶ Emilia : Um, Subaru, that man is... (0:09:45.42)
▶ Roswaal L. Mathers : Oh, no... It's quite all right, Miss Emilia... (0:09:47.72)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : What's going on? (0:09:51.48)
▶ Roswaal L. Mathers : Only that I am the lord of this
manor, Roswaal L. Mathers, (0:09:52.60)
▶ Roswaal L. Mathers : Natsuki Subaru-kun. (0:09:58.85)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : This is way better than normal food! (0:10:08.22)
▶ Roswaal L. Mathers : Despite her appearance, Rem's cooking
is quite impressive. (0:10:11.58)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : So this was cooked by the one with
blue hair... Um, Rem-chan, right? (0:10:14.75)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : You made this? (0:10:19.68)
▶ Rem : Yes, sir. (0:10:20.86)
▶ Rem : I do the cooking in this house. (0:10:22.63)
▶ Rem : My sister is not very good at cooking. (0:10:25.67)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : Ah, twins who are good at different things! (0:10:28.26)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : Is your sister good at cleaning, then? (0:10:31.87)
▶ Rem : Yes, that is correct. (0:10:34.19)
▶ Rem : My sister excels at housework,
particularly cleaning and laundry. (0:10:35.59)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : So, Rem-rin, you're good at cooking,
but bad at cleaning and laundry? (0:10:38.98)
▶ Rem : No, I am generally good at all household tasks. (0:10:43.12)
▶ Rem : I am also better at cleaning
and laundry than my sister. (0:10:46.55)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : Does your sister even have a purpose? (0:10:49.41)
▶ Roswaal L. Mathers : You are truly a strange young man... (0:10:51.80)
▶ Roswaal L. Mathers : You come to the mansion of Margrave Mathers,
in the kingdom of Lugunica, (0:10:54.74)
▶ Roswaal L. Mathers : but you claim to understand nothing! (0:10:57.81)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : Is something bad happening in this country? (0:11:01.49)
▶ Roswaal L. Mathers : Well, it is not in an agreeable state. (0:11:05.16)
▶ Roswaal L. Mathers : After all, Lugunica's king is currently not present. (0:11:07.85)
▶ Roswaal L. Mathers : No, there's no need to be concerned... (0:11:12.82)
▶ Roswaal L. Mathers : Everyone is already quite aware of the reality. (0:11:16.60)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : Really? (0:11:21.02)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : I expected a "Now that you know my secret,
I can't let you leave here alive" thing. (0:11:22.27)
▶ Roswaal L. Mathers : Around the same time that the king went into hiding,
an epidemic began spreading through the castle! (0:11:26.27)
▶ Roswaal L. Mathers : The king and his children are the last of his line. (0:11:32.21)
▶ Roswaal L. Mathers : A council of wise men currently manages the nation, (0:11:34.81)
▶ Roswaal L. Mathers : and they are now in the process
of selecting a new king! (0:11:38.09)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : I see. I'm starting to get the picture. (0:11:42.43)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : On top of the king's absence, the royal selection
is causing confusion in the kingdom. (0:11:45.18)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : Then, suddenly, I appear from another world— (0:11:48.97)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : Wait, I'm totally suspect here! (0:11:51.07)
▶ Roswaal L. Mathers : And on top of all that, (0:11:52.69)
▶ Roswaal L. Mathers : you made contact with Miss Emilia,
thus becoming connected to my household! (0:11:55.06)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : Wait, why would the lord of the
mansion call her "Miss Emilia"? (0:12:00.19)
▶ Roswaal L. Mathers : It's only natural to address someone of
higher status with all due respect... (0:12:04.48)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : Um, so Emilia-tan would be... (0:12:10.70)
▶ Emilia : My current status is (0:12:14.75)
▶ Emilia : a candidate to become the Kingdom
of Lugunica's forty-second ruler, (0:12:17.04)
▶ Emilia : with Margrave Roswaal's backing. (0:12:20.84)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : What?! (0:12:23.59)
▶ Emilia : Sorry to surprise you. (0:12:24.99)
▶ Emilia : I wasn't trying to keep it a secret. (0:12:26.69)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : Hey, it's that insignia. (0:12:30.80)
▶ Emilia : This qualifies one to be a candidate for king. (0:12:33.29)
▶ Emilia : It's a touchstone for determining
if one is worthy of the throne. (0:12:36.20)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : Wait, Emilia-tan, you lost an insignia that
qualifies you to rule the kingdom? (0:12:42.10)
▶ Emilia : Don't put it like that! I didn't lose it! (0:12:46.90)
▶ Emilia : It was stolen from me by a thief! (0:12:48.60)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : That's the same thing! (0:12:50.24)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : And what if you lose that thing, anyway? (0:12:52.28)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : Will a government office issue you another? (0:12:54.86)
▶ Roswaal L. Mathers : Oh, my! If you'd lost it, then there
would be no doubt... (0:12:56.74)
▶ Roswaal L. Mathers : If it were thought that one who
can't even protect a tiny insignia (0:13:01.84)
▶ Roswaal L. Mathers : can't be entrusted with the nation's
rule, that would be the end. (0:13:04.67)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : Now that I think about it, I did a damn good job. (0:13:08.87)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : This totally raises my expectations for a reward... (0:13:12.20)
▶ Emilia : Yeah, you're right. You were my true savior. (0:13:15.32)
▶ Emilia : So ask for anything. (0:13:19.55)
▶ Roswaal L. Mathers : You may have any reward you request.
Merely state your desire! (0:13:20.96)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : In that case, I have but one request. (0:13:27.42)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : Hire me to work in this mansion! (0:13:33.19)
▶ Ram : Achoo. (0:13:39.72)
▶ Emilia : That isn't quite right... (0:13:42.48)
▶ Emilia : Wasn't there anything else that fit you, Subaru? (0:13:44.72)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : Oddly, some of the girls' stuff fit me, but... (0:13:47.12)
▶ Rem : Our deepest apologies, sir. I mean, Subaru. (0:13:49.65)
▶ Ram : You look quite ridiculous, sir. I mean, Barusu. (0:13:53.02)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : Um, Nee-sama, you just turned my
name into a blinding curse. (0:13:55.89)
▶ Ram : Rem, looking at Barusu's ridiculous
appearance, do you notice anything? (0:13:59.58)
▶ Rem : His shoulders are shaped funny, his legs
are short, and his eyes are scary? (0:14:03.18)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : I can't do anything about two of those! (0:14:07.32)
▶ Ram : We cannot allow you to work here
in such shady-looking attire. (0:14:10.14)
▶ Ram : People would question Lord Roswaal's dignity. (0:14:13.56)
▶ Ram : Let us alter the jacket, at least.
Rem, if you please. (0:14:16.19)
▶ Emilia : All right, I have to study for the royal selection. (0:14:19.75)
▶ Emilia : Good luck with your work, too, Subaru. (0:14:22.66)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : Yep, leave it to me, Emilia-tan. (0:14:24.47)
▶ Rem : I shall take your measurements. Stand still
and keep your back straight. (0:14:27.44)
▶ Rem : Please refrain from strange noises. It's unpleasant. (0:14:34.45)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : That was beyond my control... (0:14:37.35)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : This is awkward for a guy in multiple ways! (0:14:39.36)
▶ Ram : This is the VIP room. (0:14:42.41)
▶ Ram : This is the bathing room. (0:14:43.88)
▶ Ram : This is the kitchen. (0:14:45.18)
▶ Ram : And this is the lavatory. (0:14:46.72)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : In a mansion like this, the restroom must be huge. (0:14:48.21)
▶ Beatrice : You're so great, Bubby! Your fur is the best— (0:14:51.58)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : Don't worry. I won't tell a soul. (0:14:55.96)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : The feel of that fur would make anyone— (0:14:58.00)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : Hey! Let me finish! (0:15:00.97)
▶ Ram : That was Miss Beatrice's Door Crossing. (0:15:06.20)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : So it's a spell that can connect any
door in the mansion to her room? (0:15:08.51)
▶ Ram : Once Miss Beatrice has eliminated her presence, (0:15:12.98)
▶ Ram : there is no way to find her without
trying every door in the mansion. (0:15:15.51)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : She's in here! (0:15:20.23)
▶ Puck : That was impressive, Subaru... (0:15:22.42)
▶ Beatrice : You picked the right door again? (0:15:24.20)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : What did I tell you? (0:15:26.44)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : I'm a flag-crusher who makes game masters cry. (0:15:27.58)
▶ Beatrice : I don't understand what you're saying! (0:15:30.16)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : I don't know who you are, either. (0:15:32.22)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : Ros-chi's little sister? (0:15:34.76)
▶ Beatrice : I'd never want to be his sister, I suppose! Hmph! (0:15:36.28)
▶ Puck : Betty is the librarian who oversees the
Roswaal mansion's forbidden library. (0:15:39.14)
▶ Ram : Lord Roswaal is the greatest
magic-user in the kingdom. (0:15:42.96)
▶ Ram : He has many books that must not be seen by others. (0:15:46.03)
▶ Ram : Miss Beatrice is contracted to protect them. (0:15:48.69)
▶ Beatrice : If you get it now, then go away. (0:15:51.90)
▶ Ram : This concludes our tour of the mansion. (0:15:55.70)
▶ Ram : Any questions? (0:15:58.74)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : I know it's no use saying this after it's over, (0:16:00.48)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : but shouldn't Emilia-tan be the one
with me for the tour event? (0:16:03.31)
▶ Ram : If you have no questions, let us
get to your actual job. (0:16:07.94)
▶ Ram : You will help me with my work, Barusu. (0:16:11.88)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : This must be where my hidden
skill as a butler reveals itself! (0:16:14.41)
▶ Ram : My work today is caring for the front yard
and garden, helping to prepare lunch, (0:16:18.17)
▶ Ram : polishing the silver, airing the futons,
laundry, bathroom cleaning, (0:16:22.21)
▶ Ram : and the mansion's monthly soot cleaning. (0:16:25.28)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : I'm exhausted... (0:16:29.92)
▶ Rem : This is Rem. Do you have a moment, Subaru? (0:16:32.97)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : Sure, I'm good! (0:16:35.29)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : I won't do anything weird, so come on in. (0:16:37.04)
▶ Rem : Your permission actually makes
you sound less credible. (0:16:39.56)
▶ Rem : Pardon me, then. (0:16:42.16)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : You already finished it? (0:16:45.10)
▶ Rem : When it is Lord Roswaal's clothing,
my priority is to take care. (0:16:47.06)
▶ Rem : But since this is yours... (0:16:50.23)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : Did you just imply that you cut corners? (0:16:51.48)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : I hate to admit it, but it's perfect. (0:16:56.00)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : Well? Do I look good? (0:16:58.12)
▶ Rem : Combined with the rarity of gray clothes, (0:16:59.90)
▶ Rem : no one in any kind of strange
garment could rival you. (0:17:02.53)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : Okay! Not a compliment at all! (0:17:05.55)
▶ Rem : What shall we do with that? (0:17:07.21)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : This one's easy. Got a needle and thread? (0:17:09.00)
▶ Rem : I brought them. Shall I repair it now? (0:17:11.87)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : Nah, I'll do it. (0:17:15.09)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : Don't underestimate my sewing skills... (0:17:16.77)
▶ Rem : I am surprised. (0:17:23.52)
▶ Rem : I must give you full marks for your sewing. (0:17:24.91)
▶ Rem : Like you, however, it does not seem very useful. (0:17:27.88)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : Ow! (0:17:33.12)
▶ Ram : You may get full marks for sewing, but you
are still useless with a knife, Barusu. (0:17:34.76)
▶ Rem : As always, you make such a lovely image
when peeling vegetables, Sister. (0:17:38.86)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : Your bias is so blatant, it's almost comforting! (0:17:42.49)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : I'd like a comment on my work, too! (0:17:44.93)
▶ Rem : I pity the farmer who grew those vegetables. (0:17:47.48)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : Stop! You're breaking my heart! (0:17:50.50)
▶ Ram : You do not know how to handle a knife, Barusu. (0:17:52.76)
▶ Ram : You should hold the knife still, turning the vegetable. (0:17:55.27)
▶ Ram : Frankly speaking, my best dish is steamed tatoes. (0:17:58.13)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : How can you say that with such a triumphant look? (0:18:01.53)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : Damn it, just watch. (0:18:04.31)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : My favorite blade, Shooting Star,
will show you a thing or two— (0:18:05.36)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : It sliced right through me! (0:18:08.85)
▶ Roswaal L. Mathers : It's been five days since Subaru-kun
came to the mansion. (0:18:23.35)
▶ Roswaal L. Mathers : How has he been? (0:18:26.34)
▶ Roswaal L. Mathers : By now, we should be seeing something. (0:18:28.02)
▶ Ram : Cooking, laundry, cleaning. (0:18:31.09)
▶ Ram : He is useless at all of them. (0:18:33.38)
▶ Roswaal L. Mathers : How strict of you... (0:18:35.30)
▶ Roswaal L. Mathers : And? (0:18:37.20)
▶ Roswaal L. Mathers : What of his potential as a spy? (0:18:38.37)
▶ Ram : I cannot deny it exists, but I believe
the possibility is slim. (0:18:41.02)
▶ Ram : For better or worse. (0:18:45.53)
▶ Ram : Specifically for worse, he is too conspicuous. (0:18:47.18)
▶ Roswaal L. Mathers : And if he's too conspicuous... (0:18:50.60)
▶ Roswaal L. Mathers : Despite that possibility, he certainly is carefree. (0:18:53.22)
▶ Roswaal L. Mathers : As I personally see it, interfering would be wise. (0:18:58.32)
▶ Ram : They are only children. (0:19:03.18)
▶ Ram : Even if we let them be, nothing will happen. (0:19:05.22)
▶ Emilia : It isn't that fun to watch, is it? (0:19:14.58)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : When I'm with you, nothing is boring, Emilia-tan. (0:19:16.93)
▶ Emilia : That makes me happy, even if
you're only flattering me. (0:19:20.92)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : Besides, we haven't had a chance
to talk for the past few days. (0:19:26.21)
▶ Emilia : That's right. It must be difficult for
you to learn your work here. (0:19:30.64)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : Yes, it is! It's killing me! (0:19:34.69)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : I wish I could be sequentially comforted in
your arms, on your chest, and on your lap— (0:19:37.06)
▶ Emilia : Yeah, yeah. If you can joke around
like that, you must be fine. (0:19:40.71)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : The moon sure is pretty. (0:19:49.63)
▶ Emilia : Yes, it's far beyond our reach. (0:19:52.52)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : I got a really touching response, without even trying! (0:19:54.63)
▶ Emilia : Anyway, don't you think you're
a bit lacking in ambition? (0:19:59.52)
▶ Emilia : Like that time with Puck, (0:20:02.84)
▶ Emilia : and in the capital, when you asked for my name. (0:20:04.41)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : You just don't get it, Emilia-tan... (0:20:07.34)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : I want what I want at that exact moment, (0:20:09.96)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : and I want it from the bottom of my heart. (0:20:12.80)
▶ Emilia : Huh? (0:20:16.50)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : At the time, I wanted to know your name. (0:20:17.74)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : In a new land, nervous, and unsure of the future,
I had no expectations for tomorrow. (0:20:21.61)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : When I think about it calmly, (0:20:26.04)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : there were probably other things
I should have wanted. (0:20:27.74)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : But I can't lie to myself. (0:20:31.61)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : Same with the request I made to Ros-chi... (0:20:37.35)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : I'm flat broke right now. (0:20:40.01)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : I could cheat him out of a fortune and live it up, (0:20:43.30)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : but I can just as easily obtain
a source of livelihood, right? (0:20:45.88)
▶ Emilia : In that case, couldn't you have become a permanent
guest, rather than an employee? (0:20:49.10)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : I never thought of that! (0:20:53.53)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : Oh, man, talk about pathetic... (0:20:58.48)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : You should keep your efforts a secret, huh? (0:21:00.42)
▶ Emilia : Do you want me to use my healing magic? (0:21:03.32)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : Nah, I'm fine like this. (0:21:05.53)
▶ Emilia : Why? (0:21:07.51)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : It's kind of hard to explain, but... (0:21:09.59)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : Well, this is proof of the effort I put in. (0:21:12.20)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : I don't actually dislike exerting myself, you know. (0:21:15.88)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : Learning to do something I couldn't do before... (0:21:18.96)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : Well, it's not so bad. (0:21:21.53)
▶ Emilia : That's right. Yes, I think you're right. (0:21:25.38)
▶ Emilia : Really, Subaru, you idiot. (0:21:29.80)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : Hey, what's with that reaction? (0:21:31.13)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : This is where you fall for me, all over again. (0:21:33.23)
▶ Emilia : I never initially fell for you! (0:21:35.24)
▶ Emilia : Honestly, you're so silly. (0:21:38.66)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : EMA... (0:21:44.00)
▶ Emilia : Huh? (0:21:45.22)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : It's short for "Emilia-tan, major angel." (0:21:46.18)
▶ Emilia : I'm thanking you, and you're joking around again! (0:21:48.92)
▶ Emilia : Anyway, I know you're working hard, (0:21:51.98)
▶ Emilia : but how did your hands get so torn up? (0:21:55.07)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : I cut this one with knives in the kitchen... (0:21:57.98)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : And this is from the evening when
I went shopping in town, (0:22:00.28)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : and a little animal some kids
were playing with bit me. (0:22:03.23)
▶ Emilia : It wasn't the result of your effort? (0:22:06.78)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : Those kids were ruthless, (0:22:08.95)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : hitting and kicking me, and wiping their
runny noses on me. It sucked, damn it. (0:22:10.80)
▶ Emilia : You do seem like you'd be good
with small children, Subaru. (0:22:14.77)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : I know! Wanna come with me
tomorrow, to get revenge... (0:22:18.12)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : I mean, to watch the kids and the small animal? (0:22:22.35)
▶ Emilia : It isn't that I don't want to go with you... (0:22:26.03)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : Then let's go. (0:22:29.04)
▶ Emilia : But if I'm with you, it might cause trouble for you. (0:22:30.31)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : Okay, got it! Let's go! (0:22:34.05)
▶ Emilia : Are you listening to me? (0:22:36.58)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : I am! I hang on every word you say, Emilia-tan! (0:22:37.84)
▶ Emilia : Jeez... (0:22:42.92)
▶ Emilia : Only during a break from my studies and
when your work is done, all right? (0:22:44.00)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : All right! Roger that! (0:22:50.00)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : Hey, loli girl! You're still up? (0:23:00.17)
▶ Beatrice : So now you can break through my Door
Crossing like it's natural, I suppose. (0:23:02.78)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : Oh, I just wanted to say hello before going to bed. (0:23:07.00)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : Can I try that, too? (0:23:10.63)
▶ Beatrice : Only Bubby may touch me, I suppose. (0:23:12.73)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : No fair that only you can have fun. (0:23:15.61)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : Well, I'm in a good mood, so I can let it go— (0:23:17.82)
▶ Beatrice : Enough! Just get out of here! (0:23:18.47)
▶ Beatrice : That has nothing to do with Betty, I suppose. (0:23:25.02)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : For our date tomorrow, (0:23:28.29)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : I'll have to come up with an excuse
to ditch those kids at the village. (0:23:30.37)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : Oh, but first, I've gotta learn where all the good
views and flower fields and stuff are... (0:23:33.01)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : Crap! I can't sleep while I'm thinking about this! (0:23:37.77)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : Oh, I know! (0:23:41.79)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : One Puck... Two Pucks... (0:23:43.35)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : A hundred and one Pucks... (0:23:48.07)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : A new dawn has come! A dawn of hope! (0:23:54.78)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : Natsuki Subaru will make giant strides today... (0:23:57.92)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : What?! You were in here? (0:24:02.67)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : I'm so embarrassed! (0:24:04.49)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : You should have said something! (0:24:05.84)
▶ Rem : Sister, Sister... Our guest appears
to be a bit confused. (0:24:08.09)
▶ Ram : Rem, Rem... It looks as though
our guest has gone crazy. (0:24:12.74)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : Why are you calling me a guest? (0:24:16.54)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : You two and your jokes... (0:24:19.34)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : The wounds (0:24:31.14)
▶ EXTRA : The Roswaal Mansion Family (0:24:32.28)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : are gone. (0:24:32.71)▶ Subaru Natsuki : Why... (0:00:15.05)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : Why have I gone back? (0:00:27.00)
▶ Rem : Sir, sir, you don't seem to be feeling well. (0:00:29.36)
▶ Rem : Are you all right? (0:00:32.89)
▶ Ram : Sir, sir, you seem to have a stomachache. (0:00:34.20)
▶ Ram : You didn't soil yourself, did you? (0:00:37.14)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : You don't... remember me? (0:00:41.79)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : So it's like none of it ever happened? (0:00:46.03)
▶ Rem : Sir? (0:00:51.98)
▶ Ram : Sir? (0:00:51.98)
▶ Ram : Sir, you shouldn't try to move so suddenly. (0:00:59.13)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : What happened, damn it?!
Everything reset again! (0:01:04.59)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : Including my promise with Emilia! (0:01:08.38)
▶ Beatrice : You entered without even knocking? (0:01:31.79)
▶ Beatrice : What a rude one you are! (0:01:34.09)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : Sorry... (0:01:37.06)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : Just let me stay here for a bit, please. (0:01:38.62)
▶ Beatrice : There was last time and again now. (0:01:41.60)
▶ Beatrice : How are you breaking
through my Door Crossing? (0:01:43.90)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : Beatrice... (0:01:48.81)
▶ Beatrice : Addressing me with no title, I suppose? (0:01:50.05)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : You said I broke through your Door Crossing
"last time" and "now," right? (0:01:51.68)
▶ Beatrice : I just teased you about it, three or four
hours ago, for being so insensitive. (0:01:55.98)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : If this is the second time I've
woken up in the mansion... (0:02:01.48)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : Then you remember me, right? (0:02:04.92)
▶ Beatrice : If I could, I'd rather erase you
from my memory, I suppose. (0:02:07.60)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : So the conditions are
different from last time... (0:02:12.92)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : The save point's changed from
near the guy with the appas (0:02:16.22)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : to the two angelic girls in maid uniforms. (0:02:18.89)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : How did I die? (0:02:21.55)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : Everything was normal before I fell asleep. (0:02:23.49)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : Even after I fell asleep, I wasn't in any
situation I felt might be fatal... (0:02:25.92)
▶ Beatrice : I wondered what you were muttering about,
and I hear all this about living and dying. (0:02:30.75)
▶ Beatrice : By human standards, discussing such things
is boring and senseless, I suppose. (0:02:35.16)
▶ Beatrice : In the end, you'll only get
lies and abusive speech. (0:02:38.60)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : Thanks, you were a big help. (0:02:45.53)
▶ Beatrice : I didn't do anything. (0:02:48.11)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : Somehow, seeing that your attitude
never changes calms me down. (0:02:49.90)
▶ Beatrice : Only an ultimate pervert would be
calmed by verbal abuse, I suppose. (0:02:54.24)
▶ Beatrice : You're leaving, I suppose? (0:02:59.63)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : Yeah, I want to double check something. (0:03:01.03)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : I'll wait until afterward to get depressed. (0:03:04.16)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : Yeah, I knew it. (0:03:16.43)
▶ Emilia : Subaru! (0:03:19.44)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : You're absolutely shining... (0:03:20.93)
▶ Emilia : I was worried about you! (0:03:24.43)
▶ Emilia : Ram and Rem were in a frenzy, (0:03:26.59)
▶ Emilia : saying you disappeared
right after you woke up! (0:03:28.58)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : Sorry about that... I got held
up by Beatrice for a bit. (0:03:31.37)
▶ Emilia : Again? I heard she played a trick on
you before you woke up, too... (0:03:34.99)
▶ Emilia : What is it? (0:03:41.31)
▶ Emilia : Is there something on my face? (0:03:42.57)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : Yeah, your adorable eyes,
ears, nose, and mouth. (0:03:45.07)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : Uh, I mean... (0:03:49.62)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : I'm glad you're okay. (0:03:51.57)
▶ Emilia : Yeah, I'm fine. (0:03:54.18)
▶ Emilia : You protected me, after all. (0:03:56.16)
▶ Emilia : What about you? How are you feeling? (0:03:58.73)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : I feel great! (0:04:00.95)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : I'm a little low on blood, (0:04:03.16)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : all my mana was stolen, (0:04:04.84)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : the shock of waking up sapped my strength, (0:04:06.59)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : and I feel like my mind's taken
a fatal beating with a bat, (0:04:08.57)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : but I'm good! (0:04:11.45)
▶ Emilia : I see, that's g— Huh? (0:04:12.64)
▶ Emilia : Wouldn't that mean you're hurt all over? (0:04:15.12)
▶ Puck : Hi, Subaru... Great morning, isn't it? (0:04:17.97)
▶ Puck : I can't thank you enough for yesterday. (0:04:21.68)
▶ Puck : I have to thank you somehow. (0:04:24.99)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : Then, let me pet your fur whenever I want! (0:04:26.75)
▶ Emilia : That's all? (0:04:30.05)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : Okay, let's go! (0:04:34.21)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : Our time is limited, and our world is grand. (0:04:35.56)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : And Emilia-tan's and my story
has only just begun! (0:04:37.79)
▶ Emilia : True... (0:04:41.56)
▶ Emilia : Wait, what did you just say? (0:04:42.72)
▶ Emilia : Where did the "tan" come from? (0:04:45.18)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : I don't know whose idea of a prank this is, (0:04:47.36)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : but I'll make you sorry for all of it. (0:04:49.38)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : Don't underestimate how vindictive I'll be, (0:04:52.31)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : after the smile that charmed me that night. (0:04:54.12)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : I'm going to keep my promise to Emilia! (0:04:56.48)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : I'll get past that night! (0:04:59.36)
▶ Roswaal L. Mathers : Now, state your desire! (0:05:01.43)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : In that case, I have but one request. (0:05:04.86)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : Hire me to work in this mansion! (0:05:07.16)
▶ Ram : Hic. (0:05:10.99)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : It's how these looping plots work. (0:05:12.87)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : Follow the same path, and you'll
end up in the same place. (0:05:14.78)
▶ Ram : That's too large for you, Barusu. (0:05:19.46)
▶ Ram : It appears nothing here will
fit except women's clothes. (0:05:22.86)
▶ Ram : Rem, alter that one for him. (0:05:26.04)
▶ Rem : Yes, Sister. (0:05:28.46)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : Take my measurements, then. (0:05:29.77)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : A man can withstand all
kinds of awkwardness! (0:05:31.47)
▶ Ram : We'll measure you later. (0:05:34.19)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : Huh? (0:05:35.83)
▶ Ram : Follow me, Barusu. (0:05:36.84)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : Are you going to show me around? (0:05:38.48)
▶ Ram : That can wait, as well. (0:05:40.79)
▶ Ram : You'll help me with my work first. (0:05:42.79)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : Hey, wait! (0:05:45.39)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : Retrace the same path I took yesterday... (0:05:49.25)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : That's what I meant to do, but... (0:05:54.01)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : This is totally different from last time. (0:05:57.05)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : It's like making a cheat sheet, (0:06:00.04)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : but when you see the answers,
you realize it's the wrong subject. (0:06:02.76)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : A total waste of effort. (0:06:05.37)
▶ Roswaal L. Mathers : Hi, there! May I join— (0:06:07.97)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : No, you may not. (0:06:10.01)
▶ Roswaal L. Mathers : This facility is part of my mansion, (0:06:11.65)
▶ Roswaal L. Mathers : so it is my property... (0:06:13.26)
▶ Roswaal L. Mathers : I shall do with it as I please. (0:06:15.15)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : Why bother asking, then? (0:06:17.43)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : If you want, take a bath. (0:06:19.04)
▶ Roswaal L. Mathers : My, how harsh! (0:06:20.46)
▶ Roswaal L. Mathers : And you seem not to understand. (0:06:22.67)
▶ Roswaal L. Mathers : Yes, this bath is my property... (0:06:24.75)
▶ Roswaal L. Mathers : But as part of my staff, (0:06:28.79)
▶ Roswaal L. Mathers : are you not my property, as well? (0:06:31.76)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : Chomp. (0:06:35.87)
▶ Roswaal L. Mathers : No hesitation at all! (0:06:36.54)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : This is turning out different
from what I'd expected, too. (0:06:38.17)
▶ Roswaal L. Mathers : I do not know what's bothering you, (0:06:41.74)
▶ Roswaal L. Mathers : but life is full of things
that fail to go your way. (0:06:44.67)
▶ Roswaal L. Mathers : Speaking of which, (0:06:48.16)
▶ Roswaal L. Mathers : do you think you'll be able to
get along with Ram and Rem? (0:06:49.10)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : I haven't spoken to Rem much yet, (0:06:52.21)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : but I get along fine with Ram. (0:06:54.38)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : In fact, I think she might be
getting a little too friendly. (0:06:56.49)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : I can't believe she can work
as a maid that way. (0:06:59.58)
▶ Roswaal L. Mathers : Well, Rem covers what Ram cannot. (0:07:01.77)
▶ Roswaal L. Mathers : As sisters, they must help each other. (0:07:05.05)
▶ Roswaal L. Mathers : In that sense, I think
they get by quite well. (0:07:07.12)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : Ram is just the inferior
version of her sister, (0:07:11.43)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : and all Rem does is cover for her... (0:07:13.36)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : And yet they insist Ram is superior
because she's older. (0:07:16.31)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : Their nerve is almost scary. (0:07:19.66)
▶ Roswaal L. Mathers : Speaking of nerve, yours appears
quite impressive, as well! (0:07:21.61)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : Damn, I'm dizzy from that bath. (0:07:28.43)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : Stupid Roswaal... (0:07:30.57)
▶ Ram : Cover up that sorry thing. (0:07:34.36)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : Why are you here? (0:07:36.27)
▶ Ram : I was only waiting to help
Roswaal-sama put on fresh clothes. (0:07:38.64)
▶ Ram : I'm sorry to say that I've finished my bath, (0:07:42.44)
▶ Ram : so I won't be changing. (0:07:45.61)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : I wasn't thinking about that! (0:07:46.99)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : Also, you spoil him too much!
Let him dress himself! (0:07:49.30)
▶ Ram : I will not condone disrespect
toward Roswaal-sama. (0:07:52.76)
▶ Ram : Next time, I will use force. (0:07:55.99)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : Any more, and I'll just
stir up a hornet's nest... (0:07:58.41)
▶ Ram : By the way, Barusu,
do you have plans after this? (0:08:00.81)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : No, just going to sleep. (0:08:03.77)
▶ Ram : Then please wait in your room.
I'll come by later. (0:08:05.79)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : Huh? (0:08:09.81)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : She didn't mean anything...
She didn't mean anything by it. (0:08:10.78)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : Clear my mind, clear my mind!
Emilia-tan is the only one for me! (0:08:12.76)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : Calm down, calm down... (0:08:15.23)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : One Emilia-tan, two Emilia-tans,
three Emilia-tans... (0:08:16.14)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : Am I in Heaven?! (0:08:20.23)
▶ Ram : You're too noisy, Barusu. (0:08:21.80)
▶ Ram : It's nighttime. Be quiet. (0:08:23.39)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : Eep! (0:08:25.10)
▶ Ram : Barusu, come over here. (0:08:27.44)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : Wait, my heart's already set on
someone named "Emilia-tan"! (0:08:29.69)
▶ Ram : What are you talking about? (0:08:33.23)
▶ Ram : I told you to sit here, so I can
teach you to read and write. (0:08:35.05)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : That's news to me! (0:08:38.14)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : But where's this coming from? (0:08:40.23)
▶ Ram : I could tell by watching you that
you can't read or write. (0:08:42.42)
▶ Ram : If you can't read or write,
I can't send you shopping, (0:08:45.82)
▶ Ram : and you can't write down orders. (0:08:49.10)
▶ Ram : We'll start with this collection
of children's fairy tales. (0:08:51.24)
▶ Ram : Starting tonight, I'll help
you study every evening. (0:08:54.01)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : Why are you being so nice to me? (0:08:57.00)
▶ Ram : Why else? It's so that I... (0:08:59.88)
▶ Ram : No, it's so I can get off easy. (0:09:02.68)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : That wasn't correcting yourself! (0:09:04.54)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : You're never out of character, are you? (0:09:06.10)
▶ Ram : Well, isn't it obvious? (0:09:07.54)
▶ Ram : The more you can do, (0:09:09.20)
▶ Ram : the less I have to do. (0:09:11.23)
▶ Ram : And when I have less to do, so does Rem. (0:09:13.20)
▶ Ram : It's win-win. (0:09:16.89)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : But that leaves me with piles of work! (0:09:17.96)
▶ Ram : We'll start with the basic i-glyphs. (0:09:21.56)
▶ Ram : After you master them, we'll move
to ro-glyphs and ha-glyphs. (0:09:23.93)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : There are three different types? (0:09:26.70)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : Just hearing that is depressing... (0:09:28.46)
▶ EXTRA : Natsuki Subaru

On the scene!! (0:09:29.46)
▶ Ram : You don't have time to waste on doodles. (0:09:30.30)
▶ Ram : Tomorrow's an early start, so time's short. (0:09:33.33)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : I'm sleepy, too. (0:09:36.21)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : I can't say I dislike how you insert your
own feelings at the end, Senpai. (0:09:37.39)
▶ Ram : I do believe honesty is my
most charming feature. (0:09:42.19)
▶ Ram : Now, let's begin. (0:09:45.83)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : It's so monotonous, I feel a Gestaltzerfall
phenomenon coming on... (0:09:50.44)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : But still, even if it's to make your
life easier, it makes me happy. (0:09:54.02)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : Honestly, I had the feeling
you didn't like me much. (0:09:59.98)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : And I'll probably cause more problems
for you down the line. (0:10:03.77)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : But I'll try to become
useful as soon as I can. (0:10:06.54)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : Wow... I hate to admit it, but it's perfect. (0:10:17.02)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : Guess there's no need for my
sewing skills this time... (0:10:20.22)
▶ Rem : Sewing skills? (0:10:23.31)
▶ Rem : Do you like sewing? (0:10:25.24)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : Kinda. (0:10:27.71)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : By the way, it looks like Ros-chi and
Emilia-tan have lots of outfits, (0:10:28.70)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : but I don't see any for you and Rem-rin. (0:10:33.23)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : Want me to sew some for you?
I'll take your measurements. (0:10:35.45)
▶ Rem : That is unnecessary. (0:10:38.28)
▶ Rem : These uniforms are all my sister and I need. (0:10:39.74)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : How can you have nothing but those uniforms? (0:10:43.07)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : Are all your clothes maid outfits? (0:10:46.17)
▶ Rem : They cause no problems when we accompany
Roswaal-sama on business, (0:10:47.92)
▶ Rem : or when we work in the mansion. (0:10:50.70)
▶ Rem : They also eliminate the need to explain
our place in the hierarchy, (0:10:53.29)
▶ Rem : which makes them very logical. (0:10:56.28)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : But it's not about being logical. (0:10:57.71)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : I'm trying to say cute girls (0:11:00.80)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : have a duty to dress up, so they
please the eyes of others. (0:11:02.58)
▶ Rem : My sister is one thing, (0:11:07.08)
▶ Rem : but no one would be happy to see me dress up. (0:11:08.68)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : Well, I would. (0:11:11.18)
▶ Rem : Would any good come of making you happy? (0:11:13.20)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : I might take more pride in my work here, (0:11:16.37)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : which could boost my productivity. (0:11:18.19)
▶ Rem : I have no idea what makes you say that. (0:11:20.17)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : I'd also look forward to
seeing the differences (0:11:24.21)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : in your sartorial choices... (0:11:27.57)
▶ Rem : That is none of your concern. (0:11:28.77)
▶ Rem : Does my looking the same as my sister
somehow inconvenience you? (0:11:30.47)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : You love your sister way too much. (0:11:34.83)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : Ow! (0:11:38.01)
▶ Ram : You don't know how to handle a knife, Barusu. (0:11:39.53)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : I know... (0:11:41.90)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : You hold the knife still and
turn the vegetable, right? (0:11:43.39)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : It's embarrassing when you
stare at me so intently... (0:11:49.00)
▶ Ram : Your unsightly appearance stands out. (0:11:55.02)
▶ Ram : Especially your hair. It's very unrefined. (0:11:57.91)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : I thought I did a pretty good job
of cutting it by myself. (0:12:00.56)
▶ Ram : By the way, in this mansion,
Rem sees to everyone's hair. (0:12:05.93)
▶ Ram : She styles my hair and dresses me
every morning, too. Isn't it nice? (0:12:09.93)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : Try to contribute a little, Sis! (0:12:14.23)
▶ Ram : Rem... (0:12:22.81)
▶ Ram : If you like, you can tidy up
Barusu's hair a bit. (0:12:23.84)
▶ Rem : Sister? (0:12:27.25)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : Whoa, whoa... (0:12:28.26)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : Having a girl mess with my hair
will get me all worked up— (0:12:29.43)
▶ Ram : You keep looking at Barusu because
his hair bothers you, right? (0:12:31.84)
▶ Rem : Yes, that is correct. (0:12:37.48)
▶ Rem : I think combing it and evening out the ends (0:12:39.05)
▶ Rem : would make him more presentable. (0:12:41.44)
▶ Ram : You heard her. (0:12:42.81)
▶ Ram : You should take her up on her offer. (0:12:43.97)
▶ Ram : Her hands will take you to paradise. (0:12:45.89)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : You make it sound so dirty... (0:12:48.55)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : If you don't want to,
you should just tell her. (0:12:51.61)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : Not that I don't want you to, but... (0:12:54.67)
▶ Rem : No, that isn't it. (0:12:56.66)
▶ Rem : The truth is that it did
bother me a little... (0:12:58.59)
▶ Rem : very much, a little... extremely, a little. (0:13:00.96)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : Well, anyway, that proves the
point that it bothers you. (0:13:03.51)
▶ Puck : What's the matter, Betty? (0:13:06.41)
▶ Beatrice : Nothing, Bubby. (0:13:07.90)
▶ Beatrice : More importantly, I have delicious
sweets today, I suppose. (0:13:09.75)
▶ Beatrice : Eat them with me! (0:13:12.35)
▶ Puck : Yum! (0:13:15.25)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : What's up? Here to help me? (0:13:19.51)
▶ Rem : No, this is about what we
discussed at lunchtime. (0:13:21.85)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : Lunchtime? Oh, about my hair? (0:13:25.93)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : You'll really style it for me? (0:13:29.10)
▶ Rem : No, I felt that I said some things
that were uncalled for. (0:13:30.52)
▶ Rem : I am very sorry. (0:13:34.85)
▶ Rem : We may be colleagues,
but as Emilia-sama's savior, (0:13:36.84)
▶ Rem : your rank surpasses mine. (0:13:39.84)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : That's how you feel? (0:13:42.19)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : Sorry to put you through that. (0:13:44.76)
▶ Rem : No, I should apologize for saying
something so pointless. (0:13:46.33)
▶ Rem : Please forget it. (0:13:49.82)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : I guess it's never that easy. (0:13:52.08)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : That's what makes being human so hard. (0:13:54.02)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : Okay, I'll give you a condition, then! (0:13:57.98)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : If you agree to it, I'll forget
everything you just said. (0:14:00.27)
▶ Rem : A condition? (0:14:04.68)
▶ Rem : Very well, I shall hear you out. (0:14:07.05)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : If you comb my hair a bit and even
out the ends, I'll let it slide! (0:14:10.81)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : When you respond with silence,
it actually hurts even more... (0:14:18.52)
▶ Rem : It is just as Emilia-sama said. (0:14:23.98)
▶ Rem : You have no ambition at all. (0:14:26.90)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : It's weird... (0:14:29.18)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : I'd think that'd make you fall for me
all over again, not disgust you. (0:14:31.10)
▶ Rem : My sister said your eyes take on an obscene
look when she's alone with you. (0:14:35.05)
▶ Rem : So to be honest, I was prepared
to hear you suggest that. (0:14:38.96)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : She's killing my reputation! (0:14:43.21)
▶ Rem : I accept your condition. (0:14:45.29)
▶ Rem : I shall do as you wish. (0:14:47.88)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : Then, after I keep my promise
to Emilia-tan would be great. (0:14:51.68)
▶ Rem : Promise? (0:14:55.76)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : Well, I haven't made the promise yet. (0:14:57.14)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : Scoping out our date destination before I
make the promise might be smart... (0:15:02.83)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : I've researched places with the best views! (0:15:07.91)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : That just leaves... (0:15:10.63)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : ...this. (0:15:11.73)
EXTRA : Subaru! (0:15:11.73b)
▶ EXTRA : He's back! (0:15:13.08)
▶ EXTRA : And his face looks weird again! (0:15:14.34)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : I need to make sure these guys don't find us. (0:15:16.22)
▶ EXTRA : What do you mean by find you? (0:15:19.07)
▶ EXTRA : Did you pee your pants? (0:15:19.90)
▶ EXTRA : We're playing hide-and-seek? (0:15:21.06)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : Chill, brats! I played with you earlier! (0:15:21.93)
▶ EXTRA : Let's play more! (0:15:24.63)
▶ EXTRA : Play! Play! (0:15:25.72)
▶ EXTRA : Change your pants! (0:15:26.83)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : All right, listen up. (0:15:28.62)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : Next time I come here, I'll be on a date. (0:15:30.32)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : Try to take a hint, okay? (0:15:32.91)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : I'll allow this little critter to play
with Emilia-tan, though. (0:15:35.84)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : Ow! Again?! (0:15:43.34)
▶ Rem : Subaru-kun, so this is where you were. (0:15:44.10)
▶ Rem : Are you all right? (0:15:48.26)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : I'm fine, I'm fine... (0:15:49.60)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : All done shopping, Rem-rin? (0:15:51.31)
▶ Rem : Yes, it went quite smoothly. (0:15:53.03)
▶ EXTRA : Aw, you're leaving? (0:15:56.47)
▶ EXTRA : Don't go! (0:15:57.20)
▶ EXTRA : You have somewhere to go home to? (0:15:58.33)
▶ Rem : You were quite popular with them. (0:16:01.25)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : For some reason,
kids have always liked me... (0:16:04.05)
▶ Rem : Like animals, children observe a hierarchy. (0:16:08.24)
▶ Rem : They can tell if it's all right
to belittle someone. (0:16:12.54)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : Those brats... (0:16:16.15)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : They have no respect. (0:16:18.14)
▶ Rem : Did you show them anything
about you worth respecting? (0:16:20.41)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : That's a sound argument. (0:16:25.00)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : Still, it doesn't seem right to
belittle me from the start. (0:16:27.36)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : Ram seems like she'd handle
that kind of thing well. (0:16:31.85)
▶ Rem : My sister is wonderful, isn't she? (0:16:35.00)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : Honestly, I'd think her personality (0:16:36.67)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : would cause conflict more often than not. (0:16:38.63)
▶ Rem : My sister's self-assured nature is
what makes her so charming. (0:16:41.47)
▶ Rem : I cannot be that way at all. (0:16:44.99)
▶ Rem : By the way, how are your studies progressing? (0:16:49.45)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : Let's just say I'm plugging along. (0:16:53.33)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : Ram is actually a pretty good teacher, too. (0:16:56.64)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : Though I wish she wouldn't sleep
on my bed in mid-lesson. (0:16:59.24)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : It kinda kills my motivation. (0:17:01.82)
▶ Rem : My sister only acts that way to
stimulate your motivation. (0:17:04.59)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : Why do you have such absolute
faith in your sister? (0:17:09.28)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : That isn't normal... (0:17:12.23)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : You're totally fanatical like a demon. (0:17:13.92)
▶ Rem : Fanatical like a demon? (0:17:16.76)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : It's the demon version of divine possession. (0:17:18.41)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : Sounds kinda cool, right? (0:17:20.67)
▶ Rem : Do you like demons? (0:17:21.87)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : Well, gods generally don't do anything, (0:17:25.49)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : but demons will laugh along when
you talk about future plans. (0:17:29.16)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : Especially for next year and stuff. (0:17:33.43)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : They'll laugh their heads off. (0:17:34.98)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : That smile is a million volts! (0:17:46.39)
▶ Rem : I'm going to tell Emilia-sama. (0:17:49.56)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : I wasn't trying to hit on you! (0:17:51.28)
▶ Emilia : Both Ram and Rem said they wouldn't
be coming to see you tonight, (0:17:54.75)
▶ Emilia : so I agreed to help with your studies. (0:17:59.61)
▶ Emilia : I'm afraid I can't do much, though. (0:18:02.88)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : Right now, I'm writing the basic i-glyphs
until I memorize them... (0:18:05.31)
▶ Emilia : Wow! You're studying a lot more
intensely than I imagined! (0:18:09.28)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : S-Since these fairy tales are aimed at kids, (0:18:13.70)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : it's mostly i-glyphs, or so they said... (0:18:16.51)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : So my goal for now is to
be able... to read this... (0:18:18.67)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : Anyway, um... (0:18:24.17)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : Th-The moon sure is pretty. (0:18:27.75)
▶ Emilia : Huh? (0:18:30.53)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : No! I mean, um, I have a favor to ask you. (0:18:32.30)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : Will you listen? (0:18:35.76)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : Starting tomorrow, I'll work
hard, and I'll study, too! (0:18:36.86)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : Go on a date with me. (0:18:40.77)
▶ Emilia : What does a date entail? (0:18:43.08)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : When a guy and a girl go out alone
together, that's a date! (0:18:46.40)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : Only the goddess of love knows what
will happen during that time... (0:18:49.62)
▶ Emilia : Then that means you went on a
date with Rem today, right? (0:18:53.61)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : Ugh! I didn't expect that response! (0:18:57.14)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : That didn't count! Please don't count that! (0:18:59.28)
▶ Emilia : I understand that you want us to
go out together, but where? (0:19:01.90)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : Actually, there's this really cute
little dog in the nearby village. (0:19:05.95)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : There's a flower field, too. (0:19:09.68)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : I want to see you in a field of flowers, (0:19:11.87)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : and capture the image for
eternity with my metia! (0:19:14.28)
▶ Emilia : Oh, um... The village, huh? (0:19:17.42)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : The dog is super cute! Let's go! (0:19:20.33)
▶ Emilia : But it might cause trouble for
you. And for the villagers— (0:19:23.37)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : The kids are so pure and innocent,
they're like angels! Let's go! (0:19:28.48)
▶ Emilia : Oh, all right. You leave me no choice. (0:19:32.57)
▶ Emilia : I'll go with you. (0:19:36.67)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : And the flower field is super colorful
and wonderfu— Really? (0:19:37.51)
▶ Emilia : If that will motivate you to work hard
from tomorrow on, then I will. (0:19:41.36)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : All right! (0:19:46.50)
▶ Emilia : I bet the weather will be lovely tomorrow. (0:19:50.18)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : Yeah... And it'll be a day I'll never forget. (0:19:53.12)
▶ Emilia : There you go again with... (0:19:56.75)
▶ Emilia : You were just... (0:20:02.47)
▶ Emilia : Never mind. (0:20:06.23)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : You know, it makes a guy really anxious
when you don't finish your sentences. (0:20:07.44)
▶ Emilia : Okay, Subaru-kun the butler, (0:20:12.22)
▶ Emilia : remember to work hard. (0:20:14.05)
▶ Emilia : Only those who work hard are rewarded, (0:20:15.27)
▶ Emilia : so this will be a reward! (0:20:17.91)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : All right, let's settle this, fate... (0:21:59.65)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : I won't sleep tonight, no matter what. (0:22:02.64)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : I'll stay awake to greet the
morning of my promise. (0:22:04.83)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : Jeez... What am I, a grade schooler who
can't sleep before a class outing? (0:22:09.54)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : Reminds me of when I overslept
on the day of the class trip... (0:22:14.59)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : I wasn't able to retrace
the same loop exactly, (0:22:19.37)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : but I got along well with Ram and Rem. (0:22:23.14)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : In fact, I think I did better than last time. (0:22:25.67)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : If there's anything I feel I missed, (0:22:29.72)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : it's not saying goodnight to Beatrice. (0:22:32.43)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : Each time I saw her, all we
did was insult each other. (0:22:36.15)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : But maybe I should have...
at least... thanked her... (0:22:39.53)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : What is this? (0:22:57.80)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : I'm so cold... (0:23:00.80)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : No... Could this be... (0:23:02.76)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : Someone... (0:23:10.11)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : Someone... Help. (0:23:27.50)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : What just... (0:24:07.88)
▶ EXTRA : The Morning of Our Is Still Distant (0:24:32.74)▶ Subaru Natsuki : My left arm! (0:00:20.83)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : I still have it? (0:00:23.00)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : I went back again... (0:00:25.04)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : No, maybe I should say I made it back... (0:00:27.28)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : Oh, sorry. Good morning. (0:00:33.98)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : Right, I guess you don't remember me... (0:00:38.87)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : Sorry for the trouble I've caused! (0:00:44.25)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : Natsuki Subaru will now start over! (0:00:46.31)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : By the way, what day and time is it? (0:00:50.00)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : It's my third first day in the Roswaal mansion. (0:02:24.81)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : That chill I felt... (0:02:28.54)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : Does that mean I died in my sleep the
first time, due to physical weakness? (0:02:30.12)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : But the second time, (0:02:34.41)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : there was an attacker. (0:02:36.48)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : So if I was killed, (0:02:39.19)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : does that mean the others in
the mansion are targets, too? (0:02:41.20)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : Because we're involved in Emilia's royal
selection, like at the loot house? (0:02:44.81)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : But even if I know that, (0:02:49.00)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : I have no proof to explain it
or any way to avoid it. (0:02:50.47)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : Worse yet, I didn't see the
attacker's face, or their prey. (0:02:55.55)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : My death was totally in vain. (0:02:58.44)
▶ Beatrice : You're irritating me to death. (0:03:00.24)
▶ Beatrice : Either stop it or be blown away. (0:03:02.01)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : Oh, sorry... (0:03:05.68)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : But somehow, walking in circles also
turns the gears in my head. (0:03:07.34)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : Cut me some slack, huh? (0:03:11.53)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : We're tight, aren't we? (0:03:12.68)
▶ Beatrice : Exactly what sort of relationship do
you think we have, I suppose? (0:03:14.10)
▶ Beatrice : We've only met twice. (0:03:17.38)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : Well, I won't make trouble for you. (0:03:22.64)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : Serve some tea or something, and let me relax. (0:03:25.36)
▶ Beatrice : As if I'll serve you anything, I suppose. (0:03:27.58)
▶ Beatrice : Ugh, you're irritating me! (0:03:30.44)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : What's that book you're reading? (0:03:32.83)
▶ Beatrice : It explains how to get rid of bugs that
have gotten into my room, I suppose. (0:03:35.07)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : You've got bugs in the library? That sucks. (0:03:38.90)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : What kind of bugs? (0:03:42.72)
▶ Beatrice : It's time for you to leave! (0:03:44.36)
▶ Beatrice : Your hands have stopped shaking, (0:03:46.92)
▶ Beatrice : so you can mask your fear now, I suppose. (0:03:48.60)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : You could tell? (0:03:52.07)
▶ Beatrice : You were trying to hide it, I suppose. (0:03:53.21)
▶ Beatrice : It's quite vexing to be treated
as a mere convenience. (0:03:55.19)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : You're not nice at all... (0:03:58.73)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : Thanks for the help, though. (0:04:01.02)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : I'll be counting on you again. (0:04:02.56)
▶ Beatrice : I don't want to be counted on, I suppose. (0:04:04.02)
▶ Beatrice : So don't come in here again! (0:04:06.24)
▶ Beatrice : Shoo, shoo. (0:04:09.09)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : "Shoo, shoo"? (0:04:10.75)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : Wait! When you said "bugs," you meant me? (0:04:13.36)
▶ Beatrice : Just get out of here this instant! (0:04:16.03)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : I-If not for the flower bed, that would
have been instant death... (0:04:25.36)
▶ Emilia : Um... (0:04:29.42)
▶ Emilia : Can I ask if you're all right? (0:04:32.11)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : Emilia-tan, your kindness is the
one thing that can heal me. (0:04:35.07)
▶ Emilia : You know, Rem just spread manure
in that flower bed yesterday. (0:04:39.73)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : Argh! (0:04:44.18)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : Three-second rule! That didn't count...
That didn't count, right? (0:04:45.68)
▶ Emilia : In fact, they say this kind
of thing is actually lucky. (0:04:49.42)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : Emilia-tan is already shifting
into consolation mode... (0:04:55.12)
▶ Emilia : Puck, wake up. (0:05:01.23)
▶ Puck : Morning, Lia... (0:05:08.73)
▶ Emilia : Morning, Puck. (0:05:10.78)
▶ Emilia : Sorry to ask after you just woke up,
but could you wash Subaru off? (0:05:12.68)
▶ Puck : Subaru? (0:05:17.18)
▶ Puck : Okay, I'll wash you off. (0:05:18.97)
▶ Puck : Here! (0:05:21.85)
▶ Puck : There, all clean. (0:05:28.51)
▶ Puck : Isn't that nice? (0:05:30.21)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : I thought I was a goner... (0:05:36.55)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : Wasn't there another way to do that? (0:05:38.79)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : You enjoyed that, didn't you? (0:05:40.96)
▶ Puck : That isn't true at all... Hmph. (0:05:43.63)
▶ Puck : Punch-backs! (0:05:47.29)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : Now, you've done it! (0:05:50.11)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : Like that? It's my lethal move,
Make the Cat Cry Ha Ha... (0:05:52.56)
▶ Puck : Cut it out! (0:05:55.84)
▶ Puck : Tail punch! (0:05:57.33)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : You— (0:05:58.54)
▶ Puck : And I'll finish you with my paw-pad grind! (0:05:59.09)
▶ Puck : Grind, grind, grind, grind... (0:06:02.50)
▶ Emilia : Oh, gosh... Sorry, I can't... (0:06:08.07)
▶ Emilia : What are you two doing? (0:06:09.90)
▶ Emilia : Oh, my stomach... I'm dying... (0:06:12.58)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : Well, now that I've rebounded from
my initial bad impression... (0:06:18.75)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : Thanks for your assistance, Father! (0:06:21.79)
▶ Puck : Who are you calling "Father"? (0:06:23.62)
▶ Puck : I won't give you my daughter that easily. (0:06:25.32)
▶ Emilia : Please stop. You're both too funny... (0:06:27.75)
▶ Puck : Nothing beats your smile, Lia. (0:06:31.31)
▶ Puck : You agree, too. Right, Subaru? (0:06:33.72)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : I totally do. (0:06:35.82)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : To me, Emilia-tan's smile is the first
shining star in the night sky! (0:06:38.64)
▶ Emilia : Not you, too, Subaru. (0:06:42.87)
▶ Emilia : Also, what does "tan" mean?
Where'd it come from? (0:06:45.05)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : It's what they call a pet name. (0:06:49.96)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : Just like when Puck calls you "Lia." (0:06:52.73)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : It's an expression of affection
that shows people's closeness. (0:06:55.35)
▶ Emilia : I don't remember getting so close to you... (0:06:59.68)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : That somewhat hurts, but I won't lose heart! (0:07:04.42)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : Think of it as an advance on our relationship. (0:07:08.16)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : It means I want us to get close enough
to call each other by pet names. (0:07:10.49)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : Okay? (0:07:14.49)
▶ Emilia : All right, I'll accept that. (0:07:20.01)
▶ Emilia : No... Don't look at me. (0:07:25.07)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : I expected her to cringe,
but I got a positive response. (0:07:27.66)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : What could this mean,
Commentator Puck-san? (0:07:31.59)
▶ Puck : She doesn't have many friends, (0:07:33.73)
▶ Puck : so she craves things like nicknames. (0:07:36.00)
▶ Puck : She's easy to please. (0:07:38.32)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : My main heroine is easy to please, huh?! (0:07:39.39)
▶ Rem : Sister, Sister... It's only been a short time, (0:07:41.94)
▶ Rem : and now our guest looks like a drowned rat. (0:07:44.51)
▶ Ram : Rem, Rem. In just a short time, (0:07:46.91)
▶ Ram : our guest has turned into a dirty, old washrag. (0:07:49.44)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : I know I'm a rat. You don't have to tell me. (0:07:51.77)
▶ Ram : Our lord, Roswaal-sama, has returned. (0:07:55.55)
▶ Rem : Our lord, Roswaal-sama, has returned. (0:07:55.55)
▶ Rem : Please come inside. (0:07:59.29)
▶ Ram : Please come inside. (0:07:59.29)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : Here we go. (0:08:02.47)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : My third first meeting with
the lord of the mansion. (0:08:03.80)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : All I know for certain is that someone
will attack on the fourth night. (0:08:07.48)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : It'd be ideal if I could let them know. (0:08:13.34)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : But I can't explain where I got the information, (0:08:16.09)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : so they might think I'm working
with the assassin. (0:08:18.86)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : If I just knew even the attacker's physique, (0:08:21.94)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : it might be a different story. (0:08:24.74)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : So this time, I'll use these next four days (0:08:26.99)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : to gather information and
learn who the attacker is. (0:08:29.16)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : And to do that... (0:08:33.66)
▶ Roswaal L. Mathers : You may have any reward you request. (0:08:35.48)
▶ Roswaal L. Mathers : Merely state your desire! (0:08:37.72)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : In that case, (0:08:41.58)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : let me live here as a house guest, (0:08:42.98)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : and eat and sleep all I want! (0:08:44.60)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : But how am I supposed to gather information? (0:08:54.54)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : I guess I'll start with some
indirect questioning... (0:08:58.00)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : That's where I fell. (0:09:04.24)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : Sorry for the trouble... (0:09:09.96)
▶ Rem : Of course. If you'll excuse me, sir. (0:09:11.77)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : Wait. (0:09:14.73)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : I didn't even get a chance to talk. (0:09:16.33)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : I don't see anything out of the ordinary... (0:09:24.76)
▶ Roswaal L. Mathers : What do you not see? (0:09:30.06)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : Ros-chi... (0:09:32.35)

▶ Subaru Natsuki : Hey, you can be a little friendlier
to me if you want... (0:09:54.54)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : Well, it's my first day.
I guess it makes sense. (0:10:03.02)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : Yo! (0:10:09.06)
▶ Beatrice : Every day, you come in here
without even knocking. (0:10:10.61)
▶ Beatrice : You truly have no manners whatsoever. (0:10:12.92)
▶ Beatrice : Leaving would be in your best interest,
before you get blown away, I suppose. (0:10:15.42)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : Whoa! Wait, wait... (0:10:18.77)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : I just want to ask you something. (0:10:20.28)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : Is there any magic that weakens and kills
someone, as if putting them to sleep? (0:10:22.60)
▶ Beatrice : If I must answer, then yes, there is. (0:10:27.84)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : There is? (0:10:31.76)
▶ Beatrice : But it isn't so much magic as
it is a curse, I suppose. (0:10:32.91)
▶ Beatrice : There are many such things among the
spells that shamans specialize in. (0:10:36.65)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : Shamans? (0:10:41.08)
▶ Beatrice : Magicians. (0:10:42.19)
▶ Beatrice : However, shamans are a subclass
of magic- and spirit-arts users, (0:10:43.47)
▶ Beatrice : originating in the northern nation
of Gusteco, I suppose. (0:10:47.46)
▶ Beatrice : They're all quite useless, and not
to be taken seriously. (0:10:50.06)
▶ Beatrice : But there is an easier method
than a curse, I suppose. (0:10:55.12)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : Easier? (0:10:58.83)
▶ Beatrice : I believe you've already experienced it. (0:11:00.56)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : Wait, you mean... (0:11:05.45)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : That mana drain you did against
my will could actually kill me? (0:11:07.17)
▶ Beatrice : Mana is also one's very life force. (0:11:12.69)
▶ Beatrice : If you continually suck it out, one could
die of weakness, I suppose. (0:11:15.45)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : Wait... You're not the one
who killed me, are you? (0:11:20.40)
▶ Beatrice : Sorry to disappoint you, but I'm busy. (0:11:24.18)
▶ Beatrice : I couldn't even spare the effort to kill you... (0:11:27.90)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : Is this what you want? (0:11:32.21)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : So, uh... (0:11:34.75)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : Oh, yeah. (0:11:36.21)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : Can anyone do that mana-sucking thing? (0:11:37.29)
▶ Beatrice : That's an absolutely terrible
way to put it, I suppose. (0:11:40.12)
▶ Beatrice : In this mansion, only Bubby and I can. (0:11:43.28)
▶ Beatrice : Even Roswaal can't. (0:11:45.45)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : Oh... It's actually a pretty rare skill, then. (0:11:47.55)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : Don't suck up that stuff too much. (0:11:50.76)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : Especially from me. (0:11:53.76)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : I'm really short on blood right now,
so I'd die in a heartbeat. (0:11:55.17)
▶ Beatrice : Yes, all your organs were restored, (0:11:58.63)
▶ Beatrice : but your blood wasn't replaced, I suppose. (0:12:01.20)
▶ Beatrice : Well, I have no obligation to do so, anyway. (0:12:03.65)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : My organs? (0:12:06.81)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : The way you said that (0:12:10.29)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : makes it sound like you were the
one who healed my wounds. (0:12:11.88)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : Trying to take the credit from Emilia-tan
makes you look bad! (0:12:16.50)
▶ Beatrice : That silly girl doesn't have the power
to heal fatal wounds yet, I suppose. (0:12:19.94)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : Eh? (0:12:25.35)
▶ Beatrice : She and Bubby stabilized you,
and I healed your wounds. (0:12:26.14)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : Huh?! (0:12:30.91)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : F-For real? You're kidding, right? (0:12:31.79)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : Of course... It's a lie. (0:12:34.97)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : It was a lie! It's not nice to lie! (0:12:36.51)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : No lying... (0:12:39.12)
▶ Beatrice : Shut up, I suppose. (0:12:41.53)
▶ Beatrice : You're too averse to the truth. (0:12:43.16)
▶ Beatrice : Someone not worth saving should
disappear, I suppose! (0:12:44.77)
▶ Emilia : Um... (0:12:51.10)
▶ Emilia : Once again, are you all right? (0:12:52.75)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : So, in the end, the key words
are "curse" and "chains." (0:12:56.64)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : I don't know anything else. (0:13:00.04)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : If Return by Death's conditions are the same, (0:13:02.36)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : I died three times in the capital,
and survived the fourth time. (0:13:05.28)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : But that doesn't mean I intend to
treat this as a throwaway life. (0:13:09.12)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : That's why I asked Puck to keep
an eye on Emilia for me. (0:13:13.20)
▶ Puck : Sure. (0:13:17.88)
▶ Puck : This is all really vague, (0:13:19.19)
▶ Puck : but I can tell you're asking
out of concern for Lia. (0:13:21.26)

I'll leave here and— (0:13:25.36)

▶ Subaru Natsuki : That's super rude... (0:13:34.76)

▶ Subaru Natsuki : Thanks. (0:13:45.20)

mansion's finest tea leaves. (0:13:50.93)

be more friendly toward you. (0:14:02.12)

▶ Subaru Natsuki : Not bad... (0:14:11.42)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : I can read simple fairy tales like these now. (0:14:12.78)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : It's interesting how the morals slightly
differ from those of the ones I know. (0:14:15.95)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : It's like true cross-cultural communication! (0:14:19.55)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : Maybe I should import a few fairy
tales from my homeland. (0:14:22.32)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : Like "The Red Ogre Who Cried." (0:14:25.92)
▶ Ram : The Red Ogre Who Cried? (0:14:30.41)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : Want me to tell it to you? (0:14:33.24)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : All right, your attention, please. (0:14:38.45)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : Once upon a time, there lived
a red ogre and a blue ogre. (0:14:41.23)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : The two were very good friends. (0:14:47.74)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : The red ogre wanted to be friends
with the people of the village. (0:14:51.51)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : But the people were too scared
to get close to him. (0:14:56.47)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : The blue ogre couldn't bear to watch, (0:15:00.43)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : so he devised a plan to help his friend. (0:15:02.08)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : "I'll make a ruckus in the village,
so you come and stop me. (0:15:05.74)

▶ Subaru Natsuki : The plan worked, and the red
ogre befriended the humans. (0:15:14.20)

something began to worry him. (0:15:18.99)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : His friend, the blue ogre,
no longer came to visit him. (0:15:23.98)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : One day, the red ogre went
to the blue ogre's house. (0:15:28.97)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : The door was tightly shut, and a
letter was affixed to it. (0:15:32.94)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : The letter said... (0:15:38.18)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : "Red Ogre-kun, please have fun
with your human friends. (0:15:41.07)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : If I continue to hang around you, (0:15:46.54)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : they might think you're a bad ogre, too. (0:15:49.52)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : So I've decided to go on a journey, (0:15:53.47)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : but I will never forget you. (0:15:56.76)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : Goodbye. Please take care of yourself. (0:16:00.42)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : Your friend forever... (0:16:03.98)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : Blue Ogre." (0:16:06.57)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : The red ogre read the letter in
silence, over and over again. (0:16:09.85)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : Tears fell, as he began to cry. (0:16:13.51)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : The end. (0:16:16.90)
▶ Ram : That's a sad story. (0:16:19.74)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : Yeah, it is. (0:16:21.84)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : But I think it's a sweet story, too. (0:16:23.84)
▶ Ram : I think all the characters in it are just stupid. (0:16:27.58)
▶ Ram : The red ogre, the blue ogre,
and the villagers, too. (0:16:31.96)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : That's kind of a harsh critique. (0:16:34.91)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : I mean, I'm not denying it, but... (0:16:38.14)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : That's why I both love and hate that story. (0:16:40.86)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : The blue ogre's self-sacrifice
is really appealing, (0:16:45.44)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : but it's stupid because
he gets nothing in return. (0:16:48.62)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : I'm the type that wants to be
rewarded for my effort. (0:16:51.15)
▶ Ram : Is that what you think of the blue ogre? (0:16:54.75)
▶ Ram : But it's the red ogre that I think is beyond help. (0:16:58.37)
▶ Ram : He dragged the blue ogre into his own desires. (0:17:01.96)
▶ Ram : As a result, he lost nothing. (0:17:04.32)
▶ Ram : Only the blue ogre lost anything. (0:17:06.81)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : Then what do you think the two
ogres should have done? (0:17:08.92)
▶ Ram : If the red ogre truly wanted
to befriend the humans, (0:17:13.30)
▶ Ram : he should have broken off his
horns and gone to them. (0:17:16.74)
▶ Ram : He should have done that before the
blue ogre couldn't bear to watch anymore. (0:17:20.18)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : That's a pretty extreme opinion, too... (0:17:24.30)
▶ Ram : Is it? (0:17:28.05)
▶ Ram : Which of the two ogres would
you rather be friends with? (0:17:29.42)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : Which of the two? (0:17:33.30)
▶ Ram : The red ogre, who can only wish
and be taken care of by others, (0:17:36.86)
▶ Ram : or the stupid blue ogre,
who basks in self-sacrifice? (0:17:40.33)
▶ Ram : What a foolish answer. (0:17:53.63)
▶ Ram : If you want to befriend both, (0:17:56.08)
▶ Ram : you must be the indecisive, adulterous type. (0:17:58.28)
▶ Ram : You'll regret it one day. (0:18:01.01)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : I don't recall it being that kind of story! (0:18:02.36)
▶ Ram : Putting aside your homeland's fairy tales, (0:18:06.21)
▶ Ram : did any of these stories leave
an impression on you? (0:18:09.05)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : Well, the ones that interested me most (0:18:11.74)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : were the middle one, about the dragon, (0:18:14.95)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : and at the end, about the witch. (0:18:17.58)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : I finally know where the name the "Dragon's
Kingdom of Lugunica" comes from. (0:18:19.83)
▶ Ram : Oh? (0:18:23.92)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : It said the royal family signed
a covenant with a dragon, (0:18:24.96)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : so it's more like a folk tale
than a fairy tale, right? (0:18:27.82)
▶ Ram : Yes, since it's true. (0:18:31.14)
▶ Ram : The noble dragon still protects
this nation from far away, (0:18:33.89)
▶ Ram : beyond a great waterfall. (0:18:38.57)
▶ Ram : It will do so until its contract with
the royal family is fulfilled. (0:18:41.58)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : Wait, didn't the royal family that signed
the contract recently die out? (0:18:45.71)
▶ Ram : Yes, quite abruptly. (0:18:50.81)
▶ Ram : No one knows what the dragon wants. (0:18:53.51)
▶ Ram : In the nation's current situation,
only the gods know... (0:18:56.98)
▶ Ram : No, only the dragon knows what
the dragon will do, sir. (0:19:00.82)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : Oh, by the way, about this witch story— (0:19:06.34)
▶ Ram : I don't want to discuss that. (0:19:08.86)
▶ Ram : I've stayed too long. (0:19:11.41)
▶ Ram : I'll come again to notify you
when dinner is ready, sir. (0:19:13.26)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : O-Okay. (0:19:18.50)
▶ Ram : That story you told me about the ogres... (0:19:20.87)
▶ Ram : Don't tell it to Rem. (0:19:23.82)
▶ Ram : I'm certain she wouldn't like it. (0:19:25.64)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : "A scary witch, a terrifying witch. (0:19:36.38)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : To even speak her name was terrifying. (0:19:39.69)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : Everyone called her (0:19:42.80)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : the Jealous Witch." (0:19:45.60)
▶ Emilia : Are you sure about this? (0:19:52.86)
▶ Emilia : We could call a royal car to
take you to the capital. (0:19:54.30)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : I'll be fine... (0:19:57.20)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : One day, when I'm the kind of strong,
smart, rich man who's worthy of you, (0:19:59.20)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : I'll take you away on a white horse. (0:20:04.14)
▶ Emilia : Do you have a handkerchief? (0:20:06.23)
▶ Emilia : And water, lagumite ore, and... (0:20:07.50)
▶ Emilia : Will you be able to sleep by yourself? (0:20:10.62)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : Do you think you're my mom? (0:20:12.26)
▶ Roswaal L. Mathers : Then, Subaru-kun, be well. (0:20:13.87)
▶ Roswaal L. Mathers : And do not lose the gift I gave you. (0:20:17.07)
▶ Roswaal L. Mathers : I added something equivalent to our three
days' worth of memories together... (0:20:19.52)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : Hush money, right? Don't worry, I get it. (0:20:25.43)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : I won't say anything I shouldn't.
I swear to the dragon. (0:20:28.20)
▶ Roswaal L. Mathers : Talking with you makes any evil scheme
seem to lose its purpose. (0:20:31.05)
▶ Roswaal L. Mathers : And in this nation, swearing to the dragon
is the highest form of promise. (0:20:35.87)
▶ Roswaal L. Mathers : Be sure not to forget it. (0:20:41.04)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : Got it! (0:20:43.65)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : You two helped me out a ton. (0:20:45.12)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : Especially you, Rem-rin.
Thanks for all the great food. (0:20:47.43)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : And Ram-chi... (0:20:50.64)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : Yeah! You're good at cleaning toilets, right? (0:20:52.27)
▶ Rem : Sister, Sister... Our guest is
hopelessly bad at flattery. (0:20:55.22)
▶ Ram : Rem, Rem... Our guest has a
fatal lack of skill in flattery. (0:20:59.64)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : Oh, shut up! (0:21:03.20)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : I seriously couldn't think of anything! (0:21:04.27)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : Thanks, though. (0:21:07.51)
▶ Rem : Yes, sir. (0:21:09.58)
▶ Ram : Yes, sir. (0:21:09.58)
▶ Emilia : Subaru! (0:21:17.42)
▶ Emilia : Thank you for everything. (0:21:19.95)
▶ Emilia : If you need anything, come visit anytime. (0:21:21.55)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : Sure! (0:21:25.08)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : Thanks, Emilia-tan! (0:21:28.30)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : Okay, this is it. (0:21:51.37)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : From here, I can see Emilia's
room especially well. (0:21:53.55)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : Now all that's left is to wait
for something to happen. (0:21:56.68)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : And stop it. (0:22:01.21)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : She'd probably get mad at me
for using it this way... (0:22:05.37)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : I hope she does... (0:22:10.10)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : I don't want to die. (0:22:14.01)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : I don't want them to die. (0:22:18.04)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : What did I tell you, Natsuki Subaru? (0:22:23.26)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : Even if no one remembers what
happens when things repeat, (0:22:26.18)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : you remember. (0:22:30.10)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : Now that I think about it, I didn't
go shopping for Rem this time. (0:22:36.70)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : Just because the food
meant for me was leftover? (0:22:41.18)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : It'll still be a while before dark. (0:22:45.47)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : Focus! Focus! (0:22:48.08)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : Emergency escape... (0:23:02.49)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : I saw it! (0:23:05.00)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : Yes, I saw it! (0:23:05.88)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : I saw where the sound of chains came from! (0:23:07.36)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : But is it coming this way now? (0:23:09.73)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : Does this mean I played right
into the attacker's hands? (0:23:16.26)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : If you're coming, then come! (0:23:27.12)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : Do you have the nerve?! (0:23:35.76)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : All right... Show yourself, damn it! (0:23:42.56)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : I've gone through all kinds
of hell to see your face! (0:23:45.37)
▶ Rem : Then I have no choice. (0:24:03.90)
▶ Rem : The ideal scenario would have been to
finish this without anyone noticing. (0:24:15.02)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : You're joking... (0:24:24.65)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : Right, Rem? (0:24:26.84)
▶ EXTRA : The Sound of Chains (0:24:32.78)▶ Rem : If you do not resist, I can
make your death painless. (0:00:18.43)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : Why are you doing this? (0:00:23.85)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : That's a cliché, but do you mind my asking? (0:00:26.32)
▶ Rem : If someone seems suspicious, punish them. (0:00:29.71)
▶ Rem : This is the rule of maids. (0:00:31.56)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : Does Ram know? (0:00:34.56)
▶ Rem : I intend to finish this before
my sister sees anything. (0:00:36.73)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : Is that how little you trusted me? (0:00:41.15)
▶ Rem : Yes. (0:00:46.63)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : Damn, I'm pathetic... (0:00:48.75)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : I was so sure we were getting along well. (0:00:51.00)
▶ Rem : My sister— (0:00:55.41)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : I don't wanna hear it! (0:00:55.99)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : Take this! (0:00:57.30)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : My leg! (0:01:27.91)
▶ Rem : Mana of water, heal this damaged body. (0:01:37.53)
▶ Rem : If you die so easily, (0:01:42.54)
▶ Rem : I cannot get any information from you. (0:01:44.39)
▶ Rem : If you had stabbed me with this, (0:01:52.18)
▶ Rem : you could have fled a bit farther. (0:01:54.80)
▶ Rem : I ask you this... (0:02:02.16)
▶ Rem : Are you a member of the faction that supports
Emilia-sama's rival for the throne? (0:02:03.55)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : My heart belongs to Emilia-tan forever— (0:02:08.74)
▶ Rem : Who hired you, and under what conditions? (0:02:13.46)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : Emilia-tan's smile, and it was priceless— (0:02:17.08)
▶ Rem : Are you affiliated with the witch's cult? (0:02:24.12)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : The witch's cult? (0:02:29.16)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : I don't know what that is... (0:02:31.69)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : My family has been secular for generations— (0:02:33.46)
▶ Rem : Don't play dumb! (0:02:36.04)
▶ Rem : Your bald-faced lies can only take you so far, (0:02:38.12)
▶ Rem : when the witch's smell lies thickly upon you! (0:02:40.83)
▶ Rem : When I watched you conversing with my sister, (0:02:45.23)
▶ Rem : I felt I would go mad with anger and unrest. (0:02:48.80)
▶ Rem : Someone associated with the one who
has caused my sister so much agony, (0:02:53.08)
▶ Rem : boldly encroaching on the place
in which she and I belong... (0:02:57.39)
▶ Rem : I cannot bear it any longer. (0:03:02.76)
▶ Rem : Even if I know my sister only acts friendly
with, and pretends to care for, you! (0:03:05.24)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : I don't cut my hands when I
peel vegetables anymore. (0:03:20.27)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : I can read and write now, even if
it's just the simple stuff. (0:03:26.50)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : I kept my word and studied. (0:03:31.80)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : I was able to read those fairy tales. (0:03:35.05)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : Thanks to you two... (0:03:37.65)
▶ Rem : What are you talking about? (0:03:39.68)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : I'm talking about the things you guys gave me. (0:03:41.93)
▶ Rem : I have no memory of any of that. (0:03:48.14)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : Why don't you remember?! (0:03:53.22)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : Why do you all keep leaving me behind? (0:03:57.08)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : What did I do to you? (0:04:00.41)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : What am I supposed to do? (0:04:02.10)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : What did I do wrong? (0:04:03.97)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : Why do you guys hate me so much? (0:04:05.79)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : Even when you said you'd cut my hair... (0:04:12.09)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : All that time, I... (0:04:16.34)
▶ Rem : I... (0:04:19.13)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : I really like both of y— (0:04:20.47)
▶ Rem : My sister is too kind. (0:04:30.15)
▶ Rem : Sir, have you awakened? (0:04:43.08)
▶ Ram : Sir, you're awake? (0:04:46.09)
▶ Emilia : Subaru, Ram and Rem were really worried. (0:04:55.20)
▶ Emilia : They were unusually despondent,
wondering if they'd been impolite... (0:04:59.89)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : Nothing happened between them and me. (0:05:04.54)
▶ Emilia : Subaru, are you all right? (0:05:09.61)
▶ Emilia : If something's wrong, (0:05:11.99)
▶ Emilia : you're welcome to talk to me. (0:05:12.91)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : If I could tell Emilia that it's no use,
that I can't take any more... (0:05:15.90)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : That's it. (0:05:22.08)
▶ Emilia : What? (0:05:23.26)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : All this time, I've been struggling
to change things alone, but... (0:05:24.02)
▶ Emilia : Subaru, are you sure you're all right? (0:05:28.70)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : There's something I want you to know. (0:05:32.88)
▶ Emilia : Okay. (0:05:36.68)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : Emilia... Several times up till now, I've died. (0:05:38.03)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : Whoa... Wait. (0:06:06.35)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : This is seriously no joke... (0:06:10.18)
▶ Emilia : Subaru? (0:06:16.64)
▶ Emilia : Subaru! (0:06:19.06)
▶ Emilia : What happened, all of a sudden? (0:06:20.36)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : My body moves. (0:06:27.04)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : My voice works. (0:06:28.62)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : My heart doesn't hurt. (0:06:29.84)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : But... (0:06:32.40)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : The fear is engraved in me... (0:06:35.56)
▶ Emilia : What's wrong? (0:06:39.17)
▶ Emilia : You've been acting really strange. (0:06:40.22)
▶ Emilia : Subaru, if something's going on— (0:06:42.16)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : I have a favor to ask. (0:06:43.77)
▶ Emilia : Okay. (0:06:45.90)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : Have nothing to do with me. (0:06:47.58)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : I can't tell anyone about Return by Death. (0:06:56.41)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : I've died in this mansion three times. (0:07:00.00)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : In the capital, I didn't
experience a fourth time. (0:07:02.56)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : If I die again, (0:07:06.17)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : I might not come back. (0:07:09.08)
▶ Beatrice : That's quite a cowardly look
on your face, I suppose. (0:07:11.73)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : Why are you here? (0:07:16.41)
▶ Beatrice : The brat and Bubby told me to
come and check on you. (0:07:17.90)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : Puck and Emilia? (0:07:22.18)
▶ Beatrice : Since you were acting strangely, (0:07:24.33)
▶ Beatrice : they suspected I did something to you
when you first woke up, I suppose. (0:07:26.30)
▶ Beatrice : Talk about rude! (0:07:31.13)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : I get it. I'm okay now. (0:07:33.99)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : You came to apologize. (0:07:36.89)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : That's enough. (0:07:39.02)
▶ Beatrice : Why should I apologize to you, I suppose? (0:07:40.81)
▶ Beatrice : I can't leave until I correct that notion. (0:07:43.93)
▶ Beatrice : Not only do you look gloomy, (0:07:49.68)
▶ Beatrice : but the smell is much heavier now, too. (0:07:51.98)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : Huh? (0:07:54.79)
▶ Beatrice : The smell of the witch. (0:07:55.96)
▶ Beatrice : I feel it's bending my nose, I suppose. (0:07:57.97)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : Witch... You mean the Jealous Witch? (0:07:59.71)
▶ Beatrice : What else in the world would someone
mean when they bring up a witch? (0:08:03.00)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : Why do you smell her on me? (0:08:07.19)
▶ Beatrice : Who knows? (0:08:10.30)
▶ Beatrice : Regardless, as someone who receives
special treatment from her, (0:08:11.04)
▶ Beatrice : you're a burden. (0:08:13.97)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : It's not too comforting to hear (0:08:15.35)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : I'm getting special treatment from someone
whose name and face I don't know. (0:08:17.23)
▶ Beatrice : If you have nothing to say, I'm leaving. (0:08:20.65)
▶ Beatrice : I'll tell Bubby what you told me, I suppose. (0:08:22.94)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : Wait a minute... (0:08:26.66)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : You feel sorry for what
you did to me, right? (0:08:27.88)
▶ Beatrice : I do not. (0:08:30.09)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : I'm telling Puck! (0:08:31.61)
▶ Beatrice : Well, I might feel just a
tiny bit sorry, I suppose. (0:08:33.79)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : If you regret what you did and
want my forgiveness, (0:08:38.47)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : do me one favor that I ask. (0:08:41.36)
▶ Beatrice : Let's hear it. (0:08:44.46)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : On the fifth morning, (0:08:46.75)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : the day after tomorrow... (0:08:48.49)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : Would you keep me safe until then? (0:08:50.54)
▶ Beatrice : I don't want you to bring dissension
into this mansion, I suppose. (0:08:55.27)
▶ Beatrice : This place is vitally important to me. (0:08:58.99)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : I have no intention of doing anything. (0:09:02.80)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : I just want to stop any sparks from flying. (0:09:05.23)
▶ Beatrice : What an admirable motive (0:09:07.47)
▶ Beatrice : for one who leaves even that
in the hands of others. (0:09:09.34)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : For once, I have no response to that... (0:09:12.41)
▶ Beatrice : Hold out your hand. (0:09:19.58)
▶ Beatrice : I shall grant your wish. (0:09:30.24)
▶ Beatrice : I, Beatrice, on my honor,
am henceforth bound by this contract. (0:09:33.22)
▶ Beatrice : Temporary or not, a contract is a contract. (0:09:38.70)
▶ Beatrice : I'll grant your nonsense favor. (0:09:41.22)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : Seriously? (0:09:47.29)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : I'm gonna cry because of a little girl... (0:09:49.36)
▶ Beatrice : Don't call me a little girl! (0:09:51.81)
▶ Beatrice : And if you tell Bubby, you'll regret
it, I suppose! Hmph! (0:09:53.67)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : It's that important to you? (0:09:58.02)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : That desperation of yours is
fanatical like a demon. (0:10:00.73)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : Stop! (0:10:29.51)
▶ Beatrice : You can't keep sleeping forever, I suppose. (0:10:47.49)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : Bombardier! (0:10:51.86)
▶ Beatrice : I came against my will because
it's the designated time, (0:10:53.09)
▶ Beatrice : yet you seem awfully unconcerned. (0:10:55.50)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : Falling asleep on the fourth day, (0:10:58.15)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : what kind of reckless idiot am I? (0:11:00.11)
▶ Beatrice : Quit your grumbling, I suppose. (0:11:02.17)
▶ Beatrice : Just sit wherever you want. (0:11:04.28)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : The forbidden archive? (0:11:06.97)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : Did you carry me in here while I slept? (0:11:08.99)
▶ Beatrice : I'd rather not stay in that room filled
with your stench, I suppose. (0:11:11.45)
▶ Beatrice : The forbidden library is the only place for me. (0:11:15.57)
▶ Beatrice : You need to observe proper manners, I suppose. (0:11:18.12)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : Beatrice, I'm sure I'm wrong, (0:11:21.50)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : but you didn't hold my hand
while I was asleep, did you? (0:11:24.65)
▶ Beatrice : You're wrong, indeed. (0:11:27.03)
▶ Beatrice : Even if Bubby asked me to,
I would refuse, I suppose. (0:11:28.86)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : Flat-out denial, huh? (0:11:32.03)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : I'm not sure what you mean
by "proper manners"... (0:11:34.17)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : So, hey, are you— (0:11:38.08)
▶ Beatrice : You're annoying me with all your questions! (0:11:41.16)
▶ Beatrice : Just be quiet, I suppose. (0:11:43.68)
▶ Beatrice : Calling. (0:12:02.63)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : Huh? (0:12:03.72)
▶ Beatrice : I've been summoned, I suppose. (0:12:04.58)
▶ Beatrice : Oh, right, you're here. I forgot, I suppose. (0:12:10.65)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : H-Hey, hold on! (0:12:13.85)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : If you go out there now... (0:12:15.39)
▶ Beatrice : I don't care if you want to stay here. (0:12:16.56)
▶ Beatrice : You'll be safe here, I suppose. (0:12:19.02)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : Damn it! What the hell is this? (0:12:31.40)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : Did I (0:12:43.60)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : make it through the fourth night? (0:12:45.48)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : And I thought it was so far away. (0:12:52.12)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : It was that easy... (0:12:56.89)
▶ Emilia : Subaru? (0:13:03.60)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : Emilia? (0:13:05.71)
▶ Emilia : Subaru, where have you been? (0:13:06.81)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : Oh, I was just... (0:13:08.86)
▶ Emilia : You know... (0:13:10.70)
▶ Emilia : No, never mind. (0:13:12.27)
▶ Emilia : Come with me. (0:13:13.80)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : Huh? Where are we going? (0:13:15.02)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : Emilia-tan? (0:13:17.13)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : Why are you making that face? (0:13:18.54)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : Everything will be fine now. (0:13:20.81)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : Right? I'm alive, and you're... (0:13:23.25)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : Oh, I know! Let's go to the village! (0:13:27.20)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : There's so much I want to do and tell you! (0:13:30.17)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : So much has happened! (0:13:32.99)
▶ Emilia : Subaru... (0:13:35.37)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : Emilia? (0:13:39.56)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : How... (0:14:03.40)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : Why is Rem dead? (0:14:05.29)
▶ Ram : Don't touch her! (0:14:15.63)
▶ Ram : Don't touch Rem... (0:14:17.73)
▶ Ram : Don't touch my little sister! (0:14:20.07)
▶ Roswaal L. Mathers : She died of weakness. (0:14:33.74)
▶ Roswaal L. Mathers : It was as if she merely fell asleep. (0:14:36.57)
▶ Roswaal L. Mathers : The method was more of a curse than a spell. (0:14:39.85)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : I thought it was Rem who used that curse. (0:14:43.98)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : So Rem isn't the shaman? (0:14:46.75)
▶ Roswaal L. Mathers : My dear guest, have you any idea
what might have occurred? (0:14:49.31)
▶ Roswaal L. Mathers : After this has happened to a dear
member of my staff, (0:14:54.33)
▶ Roswaal L. Mathers : I seem to be a little bit angry. (0:14:57.34)
▶ Emilia : Subaru, (0:15:00.38)
▶ Emilia : if you know anything, tell us. (0:15:01.84)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : I want to spill it all and get it off my chest. (0:15:08.24)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : Ow! (0:15:19.44)
▶ Ram : If you know something, spill it all! (0:15:23.62)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : Wait, Ram! That's... (0:15:27.69)
▶ Beatrice : I keep my promises. (0:15:30.70)
▶ Beatrice : As long as he remains in this mansion, (0:15:33.13)
▶ Beatrice : I am contracted to protect him, I suppose. (0:15:35.77)
▶ Ram : Beatrice-sama? (0:15:38.08)
▶ Roswaal L. Mathers : Roswaal, he spent last night in the
forbidden library, I suppose. (0:15:39.82)
▶ Roswaal L. Mathers : So he surely had nothing to do with— (0:15:43.29)
▶ Roswaal L. Mathers : There is no further need to emphasize
the situation at hand. (0:15:45.26)
▶ Roswaal L. Mathers : However, to guard him with your life, (0:15:48.58)
▶ Roswaal L. Mathers : you must have taken quite a liking to him. (0:15:52.14)
▶ Beatrice : Save the jokes for your makeup
and weird fetishes, I suppose. (0:15:55.03)
▶ Ram : None of that even matters! (0:16:02.20)
▶ Ram : Get out of the way. (0:16:07.21)
▶ Ram : Let me through. (0:16:09.10)
▶ Ram : I must avenge Rem. (0:16:11.31)
▶ Ram : If you know anything, tell me. (0:16:13.13)
▶ Ram : Help me. (0:16:15.42)
▶ Ram : Help Rem! (0:16:16.46)
▶ Emilia : I'm sorry, Ram. Despite all this, (0:16:28.31)
▶ Emilia : I choose to trust Subaru. (0:16:30.80)
▶ Emilia : Subaru, please. (0:16:33.08)
▶ Emilia : If you can save Ram... If you can save Rem, (0:16:34.51)
▶ Emilia : please do. (0:16:38.06)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : I'm sorry. (0:16:43.91)
▶ Emilia : Subaru! (0:16:56.44)
▶ Ram : I'm going to kill you! (0:16:58.87)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : I ran. (0:17:04.35)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : I ran away. (0:17:06.44)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : I ran away from them. (0:17:08.91)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : I can't go back there again. (0:17:13.84)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : What choice did I have? What could I... (0:17:18.92)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : And I was (0:17:22.85)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : having so much fun! (0:17:24.29)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : This looks like the place where I died. (0:17:35.00)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : Where I died? (0:17:38.62)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : If I die... (0:17:42.87)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : Will I be saved from this whole situation? (0:17:44.52)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : Of course... If I die, everything will change. (0:17:48.62)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : If I struggled and fought so much,
only to end up here, (0:17:53.21)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : then what's the point? (0:17:57.73)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : The cliff... (0:18:02.51)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : If I close my eyes and take
one step, it'll all be over. (0:18:15.92)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : What will happen to me if I die again? (0:18:21.71)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : It's just one more step... (0:18:33.48)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : I can't even... (0:18:36.51)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : I can't even do something so simple. (0:18:38.63)
▶ Beatrice : I finally found you. (0:18:48.66)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : Why... (0:18:55.13)
▶ Beatrice : What, I suppose? (0:18:56.62)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : Why did you come for me? I... (0:18:58.64)
▶ Beatrice : The contract I entered into was to protect you. (0:19:01.50)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : I thought you were only supposed to be
my bodyguard until this morning. (0:19:06.99)
▶ Beatrice : You must be mistaken, I suppose. (0:19:11.77)
▶ Beatrice : I don't remember discussing a time limit. (0:19:14.70)
▶ Beatrice : Clinging to hope only serves your
own convenience, I suppose. (0:19:19.48)
▶ Beatrice : What was lost can't be reclaimed. (0:19:23.63)
▶ Beatrice : You'll have no more chances to explain
yourself to the older sister. (0:19:26.29)
▶ Beatrice : You threw that away. (0:19:29.46)
▶ Beatrice : No matter which is lost, those sisters won't
ever be complete again, I suppose. (0:19:32.56)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : But I cared about those two, (0:19:37.04)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : and I wanted to protect them! (0:19:40.49)
▶ Beatrice : What do you know about them, I suppose? (0:19:42.35)
▶ Beatrice : No matter which is lost, they won't
be restored to what they were. (0:19:45.64)
▶ Beatrice : They can't be. (0:19:49.38)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : So in the end, (0:19:52.36)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : I was just making a selfish, disgraceful
fuss, not knowing anything? (0:19:54.10)
▶ Beatrice : At the least, (0:20:00.52)
▶ Beatrice : you need to die where I can't see you,
or I'll have bad dreams, I suppose. (0:20:01.94)
▶ Beatrice : So I'll help you escape this domain. (0:20:06.80)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : Come to think of it, back then, (0:20:23.02)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : someone was holding both my hands. (0:20:25.26)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : Ram... Rem... (0:20:32.76)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : If they couldn't bear to see me suffer, (0:20:36.92)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : and held both my hands... (0:20:39.90)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : If that was the kind of people they are, (0:20:43.25)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : how can I leave them? (0:20:45.42)
▶ Ram : I'm going to kill you! (0:20:47.97)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : I heard a voice filled with hatred. (0:20:51.80)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : But more than that... (0:20:54.65)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : Her cries won't leave my mind. (0:20:59.59)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : I've always been the type to drift toward
whichever path was easiest. (0:21:07.83)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : Hey, Subaru, you're thinking about
something pretty stupid. (0:21:16.38)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : And after I managed to save this life... (0:21:21.82)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : That's right. I saved my life, so... (0:21:28.04)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : What's wrong with taking the path that's
easiest, that will let me live longer? (0:21:31.52)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : I'll decide how I use my life! (0:21:36.10)
▶ Beatrice : You were too slow. (0:21:41.92)
▶ Ram : I finally found you. (0:21:47.86)
▶ Ram : I won't let you get away. (0:21:50.07)
▶ Beatrice : Stay back, I suppose. (0:21:52.41)
▶ Beatrice : As long as my contract exists, (0:21:53.75)
▶ Beatrice : I won't hold back, not even against you. (0:21:55.54)
▶ Ram : And you, Beatrice-sama, seem to forget
that we aren't in the mansion now. (0:21:58.45)
▶ Ram : We're in the forest, away from
the forbidden library. (0:22:03.04)
▶ Ram : Are you certain you can protect him from me? (0:22:05.77)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : Boing! (0:22:13.69)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : Oh, yeah, that feels good! (0:22:17.31)
▶ Beatrice : Wh-Wh-Wh-What are you doing?!
D-Do you want to die?! (0:22:19.39)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : Don't be dumb. (0:22:24.90)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : I don't want to die in the slightest. (0:22:26.66)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : I'm fine with dying just once,
at the end of a long life. (0:22:28.66)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : That's how I really feel. (0:22:32.62)
▶ Ram : You have guts. (0:22:35.05)
▶ Ram : You finally accept your fate? (0:22:36.79)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : I wouldn't call it that. (0:22:39.10)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : If anything, (0:22:41.32)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : I'd say I've made up my mind. (0:22:43.06)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : Sorry... I caused a lot of grief for
you guys by being such a loser. (0:22:47.17)
▶ Ram : You really do know something about Rem? (0:22:52.91)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : No, sorry, but I honestly don't know a thing. (0:22:54.68)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : Frankly, there's too much I don't know. (0:22:57.55)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : But... (0:22:59.92)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : I decided to learn more about
the things I don't know. (0:23:01.53)
▶ Ram : How can you say that now? (0:23:05.73)
▶ Ram : Rem is already dead. (0:23:07.71)
▶ Ram : What can you do by learning anything now?! (0:23:09.68)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : I won't make any cool statements
about what I'll be able to do. (0:23:13.07)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : After all, this is what happened
when I couldn't do anything... (0:23:16.54)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : I know better than anyone that my words
aren't convincing in the least. (0:23:19.80)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : But I do remember... (0:23:23.40)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : I know parts of you two that you've forgotten! (0:23:25.53)
▶ Ram : What do you know about Rem and me?! (0:23:28.42)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : You're right. (0:23:31.92)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : I don't know anything that's really important. (0:23:33.19)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : But you don't know, either, do you?! (0:23:36.78)
▶ Ram : Know what? (0:23:40.72)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : That I love you guys! (0:23:44.52)
▶ Beatrice : Wait! (0:23:51.64)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : This is something only I can do! (0:24:17.84)
▶ Ram : I'm going to kill you! (0:24:23.39)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : I'm going to save you! (0:24:27.96)
▶ EXTRA : Natsuki Subaru's start (0:24:32.78)▶ Subaru Natsuki : I'm back here again... (0:00:18.99)
▶ Rem : Sister, Sister... It appears our
guest is still half-asleep. (0:00:21.44)
▶ Ram : Rem, Rem... (0:00:25.68)
▶ Ram : For one so young, it's quite
sad how out of it he is. (0:00:26.56)
▶ Rem : What is the matter, sir? (0:00:39.16)
▶ Rem : Do you feel unwell? (0:00:41.02)
▶ Ram : What's wrong, sir? (0:00:42.36)
▶ Ram : Do you have a chronic illness flaring up? (0:00:43.85)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : Let me see your hands. (0:00:45.78)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : So it's true... (0:00:52.22)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : I wasn't mistaken... (0:00:55.36)
▶ Rem : No, sir. I think you are
mistaken about everything. (0:00:58.68)
▶ Ram : No, sir. I think your
very birth was a mistake. (0:01:02.19)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : When I think about what's to come,
I can't laugh off that comment. (0:01:05.76)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : But right now, even that's a good feeling. (0:01:09.71)
▶ Rem : Sister, Sister... (0:01:11.76)
▶ Rem : Could our guest be a troubled man,
deriving pleasure from torture? (0:01:12.82)
▶ Ram : Rem, Rem, our guest appears to be (0:01:16.03)
▶ Ram : a pervert who's turned on by insults. (0:01:17.82)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : Sorry to do that out of the blue, (0:01:20.38)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : but I trust you both. (0:01:22.70)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : Let's be friends, okay? (0:01:26.43)
▶ Emilia : It was awfully noisy, so I came to check. (0:01:30.33)
▶ Emilia : Subaru, I'm glad you seem well. (0:01:32.91)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : A second ago, I had a lot on my mind, (0:01:35.20)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : but seeing you blew it all away, Emilia-tan! (0:01:37.76)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : I guess you were the wonder
drug that my heart needed. (0:01:40.29)
▶ Emilia : Sorry, I have no idea what you're saying. (0:01:43.66)
▶ Emilia : But good morning. I'm glad you're well. (0:01:46.42)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : Yeah, good morning. (0:01:48.67)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : Okay, might as well get started... (0:01:51.03)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : Hire me to work in this mansion! (0:03:26.73)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : I must clear two broad conditions, (0:03:30.57)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : in order to survive a week in Roswaal's mansion. (0:03:32.44)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : First is to earn the trust of the staff here. (0:03:35.96)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : If I don't gain those girls' favor, (0:03:39.65)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : they're liable to kill me, to silence me. (0:03:42.03)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : That goes not only for Rem and Ram, (0:03:45.98)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : but for their master, Roswaal, as well. (0:03:47.99)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : And second is to defeat the shaman
that attacks Roswaal's mansion! (0:03:51.94)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : I'm exhausted... (0:04:00.51)
▶ Puck : You're quite the hard worker. (0:04:01.72)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : I'm not done yet. (0:04:04.19)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : I need to prepare dinner and clean the rooms. (0:04:05.88)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : I'll get back to work after a little break. (0:04:07.87)
▶ Puck : It's only your first day, and you're so spirited. (0:04:10.27)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : Well... (0:04:12.43)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : Some important things are at stake here. (0:04:15.05)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : By the way, what kind of magic
does Emilia-tan use? (0:04:22.28)
▶ Puck : Technically, Lia isn't really a magic-user. (0:04:27.29)
▶ Puck : That goes for her contract with me, too. (0:04:30.33)
▶ Puck : She uses spirit arts. (0:04:33.24)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : So those who use magic and
spirit arts are different... (0:04:35.09)
▶ Puck : Magic-users cast magic with their own mana, (0:04:38.11)
▶ Puck : but those who use spirit arts draw
from mana in the atmosphere. (0:04:42.07)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : And how are those two different, Sensei? (0:04:46.38)
▶ Puck : Basically, it depends on whether you use a gate. (0:04:48.60)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : A gate? (0:04:51.50)
▶ Puck : Mana passes through a gate within your body. (0:04:52.72)
▶ Puck : Through the gate, you both draw
mana in and expel it out. (0:04:56.22)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : I see, so it's like a spigot for MP... (0:05:00.70)
▶ Puck : You should also have one, Subaru. (0:05:03.82)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : R-Really? Does that mean
I can use magic, too? (0:05:05.60)
▶ Puck : Want me to figure out your attribute? (0:05:09.03)
▶ Puck : Magic-users are divided into fire, water,
wind, and earth attributes... (0:05:12.09)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : Whoa, it's totally a magic sound effect! (0:05:19.44)
▶ Puck : I know what your attribute is. (0:05:21.30)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : Yes! I've been waiting for this! (0:05:23.05)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : Is it the burning fire of passion? (0:05:25.08)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : Or a relaxed, cool-guy water type? (0:05:26.34)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : Or maybe a gentle wind,
blowing across the plain? (0:05:29.07)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : Or is it solid, reliable earth? (0:05:31.50)
▶ EXTRA : Shadow (0:05:34.14)
▶ Puck : Shadow. (0:05:34.58)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : All rejected?! (0:05:35.20)
▶ Emilia : Wow, shadow? That's very rare. (0:05:36.54)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : What is shadow, anyway? (0:05:39.43)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : Weren't there only four attributes? (0:05:41.00)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : This is a category error! (0:05:42.43)
▶ Puck : In addition to the four basic attributes, (0:05:44.06)
▶ Puck : there's also shadow and light. (0:05:46.11)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : Is it actually some amazing ability? (0:05:48.24)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : Like a talent only seen once
in five thousand years? (0:05:50.64)
▶ Emilia : With shadow magic, (0:05:53.08)
▶ Emilia : you can obstruct an opponent's
vision, block sound, (0:05:55.58)
▶ Emilia : slow movements, and things like that. (0:05:58.81)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : It's just debuffs? (0:06:00.72)
▶ Puck : An easy one would be something like Shamac. (0:06:02.32)
▶ Emilia : That's a blinding spell, right? (0:06:04.89)
▶ Puck : Want me to show you? (0:06:08.76)
▶ Emilia : Wait, Puck... (0:06:10.37)
Subaru Natsuki : For real? Let's see, let's see! (0:06:10.37b)
▶ Puck : Shamac! (0:06:13.03)
▶ Puck : Okay, that's it. (0:06:27.57)
▶ Puck : What'd you think? That was Shamac. (0:06:30.37)
▶ Emilia : Are you all right? (0:06:32.95)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : I-I'm fine! (0:06:36.51)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : It's not too flashy, but it
seems pretty effective! (0:06:38.04)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : So I can also use this Shamac, right? (0:06:40.72)
▶ Puck : Well, that depends on your training. (0:06:43.47)
▶ Puck : Want to try the beginner's course? (0:06:45.73)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : Please, Master! (0:06:47.60)
▶ Puck : I'll act as a support, and use
the mana inside you, (0:06:50.77)
▶ Puck : so the magic will come from your own gate. (0:06:54.10)
▶ Puck : Lia, on the off-chance that Subaru's magic
goes out of control and explodes, (0:06:56.85)
▶ Puck : you should step away, so your
clothes don't get messy. (0:07:00.62)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : That only happens if I screw up really bad, right?! (0:07:03.88)
▶ Puck : If you can make relaxed, lighthearted
comments like that, you'll be fine. (0:07:07.40)
▶ Puck : Now, visualize the flow of
mana through your body. (0:07:10.55)
▶ Puck : Then expel a part of it,
through your gate, out of your body. (0:07:15.13)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : Visualizing, I can do. (0:07:19.27)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : Fantasizing is what I do best. (0:07:20.99)
▶ Puck : Huh? That isn't good. The gate just— (0:07:30.22)
▶ Puck : Long story short, (0:07:40.67)
▶ Puck : your control over your gate isn't very good, (0:07:42.10)
▶ Puck : so you shouldn't try too hard. (0:07:44.46)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : You're the one who said I'd be fine. (0:07:46.11)
▶ Puck : Tee-hee! (0:07:48.70)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : That's not cute at all... (0:07:49.53)
▶ Puck : Well, for better or worse, your gate
hasn't been well-used. (0:07:51.10)
▶ Puck : That's why the mana inside ignored
the user's will, bursting out. (0:07:55.15)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : What am I, a soy sauce bottle with a loose cap? (0:07:59.74)
▶ Emilia : You shouldn't move. (0:08:04.12)
▶ Emilia : You used up all the mana in your body. (0:08:06.08)
▶ Emilia : Maybe you shouldn't work anymore today— (0:08:08.83)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : No! I have to! (0:08:10.91)
▶ Emilia : Don't try to overdo it! (0:08:12.33)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : This is exactly when I need to overdo it... (0:08:14.41)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : I can't waste a single day. (0:08:16.78)
▶ Emilia : You really are hopeless... (0:08:20.05)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : What— (0:08:24.03)
▶ Emilia : Chew. (0:08:26.53)
▶ Emilia : Chew and swallow it. Three... And go! (0:08:28.37)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : Wh-What was that? (0:08:34.69)
▶ Emilia : It's a bocco fruit. (0:08:37.96)
▶ Emilia : When you eat it, your mana activates, (0:08:40.11)
▶ Emilia : and your gate regains a little of its strength. (0:08:42.83)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : Sorry, I guess I've caused you some trouble. (0:08:47.31)
▶ Emilia : You don't understand, Subaru... (0:08:51.53)
▶ Emilia : It's more satisfying to hear a single
"thank you" than a lot of "sorry"s. (0:08:54.80)
▶ Emilia : I did it because I wanted to help, (0:09:01.40)
▶ Emilia : not because I wanted an apology. (0:09:03.24)
▶ Emilia : Okay? (0:09:05.77)
▶ Roswaal L. Mathers : So, Ram, given what you've seen so far, (0:09:10.78)
▶ Roswaal L. Mathers : what do you think of him? (0:09:14.05)
▶ Ram : In terms of abilities,
he's completely incompetent, (0:09:17.26)
▶ Ram : but when it counts, he can be
excessively quick-witted. (0:09:20.22)
▶ Ram : I believe it may be necessary to keep
an eye on him for a time. (0:09:23.42)
▶ Roswaal L. Mathers : This is a problem we must
handle with utmost care. (0:09:27.01)
▶ Roswaal L. Mathers : Be sure to give the proper warnings, (0:09:31.58)
▶ Roswaal L. Mathers : so your sister does not act rashly... (0:09:34.28)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : I guess that's about all I can
expect of the first day. (0:09:38.93)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : I earned quite a bit of trust from
Ram and Rem, I think. (0:09:41.88)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : But the problem is that shaman's attack... (0:09:46.35)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : How do I fight that? (0:09:48.95)
▶ Beatrice : You want to know more about shamans? (0:09:53.15)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : Yeah, how do you avoid curses? (0:09:55.53)
▶ Beatrice : There isn't a way. (0:09:59.14)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : Huh? (0:10:01.00)
▶ Beatrice : Once a curse is activated, there isn't
any way to undo it, I suppose. (0:10:01.74)
▶ Beatrice : Once it's activated, that's it. (0:10:06.35)
▶ Beatrice : That's what curses are. (0:10:08.04)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : It's actually possible to nullify
instant death resistances? (0:10:09.97)
▶ Beatrice : However, before they're activated,
curses are just simple spells, (0:10:13.16)
▶ Beatrice : so I can easily undo them. (0:10:17.06)
▶ Beatrice : The scent of the witch... (0:10:21.96)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : You know, Rem mentioned that, too. (0:10:23.73)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : Who is this witch? (0:10:26.49)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : Are witches related to shamans? (0:10:28.40)
▶ Beatrice : In this world, the word "witch"
only refers to one person. (0:10:33.12)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : The Jealous Witch? (0:10:39.73)
▶ Beatrice : Exactly. The Jealous Witch, Satella. (0:10:41.32)
▶ Beatrice : Long ago, she devoured the six witches
who bore the names of the deadly sins, (0:10:44.45)
▶ Beatrice : and drained half the world dry.
She's the worst of the worst, I suppose. (0:10:48.71)
▶ Beatrice : It's said that she was starved for love. (0:10:53.27)
▶ Beatrice : It's said that she doesn't
understand human language. (0:10:56.25)
▶ Beatrice : It's said that her body never
withers, weakens, or dies. (0:10:59.53)
▶ Beatrice : It's said that, though she was sealed by the
powers of a dragon, a hero, and a sage, (0:11:04.59)
▶ Beatrice : they were unable to destroy her flesh. (0:11:09.02)
▶ Beatrice : It's said that her body is that
of a half-elf with silver hair. (0:11:11.56)
▶ Emilia : I'm... (0:11:19.29)
▶ Emilia : Satella. (0:11:20.80)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : What would it take to make someone
steal the Jealous Witch's name? (0:11:23.41)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : Oh, I guess "steal" makes
the person sound bad... (0:11:26.84)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : I should say to make someone "borrow"
the Jealous Witch's name. (0:11:29.91)
▶ Beatrice : Either way, they must have
no fear of death, I suppose. (0:11:33.72)
▶ Beatrice : One who would steal her name can
be called nothing but insane. (0:11:36.73)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : I see... So that's why. (0:11:45.32)
▶ Beatrice : Huh? (0:11:47.69)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : If people just saw her as a crazy freak, (0:11:48.43)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : she wouldn't have to be involved
in this royal selection mess... (0:11:50.81)
▶ Beatrice : What are you talking about, I suppose? (0:11:54.21)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : Nothing. (0:11:58.01)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : Good morning! (0:12:00.97)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : It's another sunny day, perfect for drying laundry! (0:12:02.81)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : Let's make this a happiness-filled day! (0:12:05.31)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : Now... Victory! (0:12:07.42)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : Victory! (0:12:11.78)
▶ Emilia : You're so energetic again this morning. (0:12:13.08)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : Yep! Even as I'm ordered around and
disciplined by the maid sisters, (0:12:15.55)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : I'll enjoy my servant's life to the fullest again! (0:12:19.90)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : But when that lifestyle wears me out, (0:12:21.91)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : I'll come rest my head in your lap, (0:12:24.14)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : so save it for me, okay? (0:12:26.17)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : When you wash your face like that,
you really do look like a cat! (0:12:27.61)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : So, do spirits get sleepy and stuff, too? (0:12:30.27)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : Do they oversleep? (0:12:32.53)
▶ Puck : Don't you people get sleepy
when you're fatigued, too? (0:12:34.71)
▶ Puck : When a spirits' mana, the source
of their energy, is depleted, (0:12:38.26)
▶ Puck : they experience something similar... (0:12:42.04)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : Did you two stay up all night or what? (0:12:45.21)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : I bet you were up late talking
about who you like, right? (0:12:47.23)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : Let me in on the fun! (0:12:50.34)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : Eh? (0:12:52.07)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : Who I like? It's embarrassing to say, but— (0:12:52.64)
▶ Emilia : The one I like is Puck, and the
one Puck likes is me. (0:12:55.58)
▶ Emilia : There. That conversation's over. (0:12:59.05)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : Your love is mutual?! Then where do I fit in? (0:13:00.42)
▶ Puck : Nowhere. (0:13:03.23)
▶ Puck : Lia's head-over-heels for my charms. (0:13:04.09)
▶ Puck : You aren't a bad guy, (0:13:07.05)
▶ Puck : but compared to me, you've got nothing... (0:13:08.96)
▶ Puck : You should give up on Lia and— (0:13:11.48)
▶ Emilia : Don't get carried away, you two. (0:13:14.32)
▶ Emilia : If you keep this up, I'll get mad! (0:13:16.44)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : Ow! Ow! You are mad! You are mad! (0:13:18.86)
▶ Puck : Ow! Ow! You are mad! You are mad! (0:13:18.86)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : Whoops! (0:13:21.37)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : I should get going, or the maid
sisters will be angry. (0:13:22.57)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : Bye. (0:13:25.34)
▶ Puck : What's wrong? You don't look happy. (0:13:29.37)
▶ Emilia : I just feel... sort of uneasy. (0:13:33.16)
▶ Emilia : I can't really explain it... (0:13:36.25)
▶ Puck : Well, I can't blame you for being confused. (0:13:39.22)
▶ Puck : This has gotten to be a bit of a problem. (0:13:41.96)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : Don't worry! Don't worry!
Forget about it! It's fine! (0:13:46.02)
▶ Emilia : A problem? (0:13:49.21)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : Relax! (0:13:50.26)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : I'll clean this up so fast, no one will get hurt! (0:13:51.42)
▶ Puck : Subaru's mind is really mixed up. (0:13:54.67)
▶ Puck : The inside and outside are all confused. (0:13:58.02)
▶ Rem : I think that is an admirable attitude, (0:14:01.70)
▶ Rem : but you were the one who knocked it over. (0:14:04.25)
▶ Rem : I shall fetch a replacement— (0:14:07.24)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : No, that's okay! (0:14:08.65)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : I'll take care of the vase and flowers! (0:14:10.00)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : You just do your own work, Senpai! (0:14:12.36)
▶ Puck : If he keeps this up, he'll wear
himself out before long. (0:14:15.61)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : It feels great to finish a job, huh, Rem-rin? (0:14:23.40)
▶ Rem : But it was work you created and
took care of on your own. (0:14:27.39)
▶ Rem : When did you learn where the vases are kept? (0:14:32.34)
▶ Ram : Did my sister... (0:14:35.71)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : Yeah, that's right! Your sister told me! (0:14:36.58)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : Since she knows me, she said, "You're
bound to break a vase eventually. (0:14:39.29)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : I'll tell you where the extra vases
are, so you'll be prepared." (0:14:42.86)
▶ Rem : Subaru-kun... (0:14:47.63)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : Whoops! I forgot about some work
Ram-chi asked me to do! (0:14:48.38)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : Would you excuse me for a bit?
I'll take care of it quick. (0:14:51.97)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : Later! I'll come find you soon! (0:14:54.54)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : I feel sick... (0:14:58.76)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : Don't you think my knife technique has
come a long way in only a day? (0:15:02.33)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : I think my talent has awakened! (0:15:06.25)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : I feel sick. I feel sick. I feel sick! (0:15:07.31)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : Rem-rin, check out my aptitude,
which enables such detailed crafting! (0:15:09.32)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : A miracle must be residing
in my fingertips right now! (0:15:13.19)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : Illusion! (0:15:16.08)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : I feel sick...I feel sick... I feel sick...
I feel sick... I feel sick... I feel sick... (0:15:17.29)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : Honestly, Emilia-tan! Every time
we meet, you stir my heart! (0:15:22.45)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : You're such a sinful girl! You're guilty! (0:15:25.52)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : I should be better able to laugh. (0:15:29.18)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : I should be better able to make them laugh. (0:15:31.36)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : I can't fail this time... (0:15:33.76)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : I can't waste a single second. (0:15:35.42)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : I must throw all my strength into my
work and produce results, or... (0:15:37.47)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : Oh, Ram-chi! I wasn't slacking!
I'll finish all my work! (0:15:41.74)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : You can just kick back in your room
and take a siesta while I— (0:15:46.14)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : Damn, I look so lame... (0:15:56.52)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : I don't have time to spend whining. (0:15:59.49)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : You idiot. (0:16:02.93)
▶ Emilia : Subaru... (0:16:06.59)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : Emilia-tan! (0:16:09.21)
▶ Emilia : Subaru, come with me. (0:16:10.55)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : Uh-oh! A personal request from Emilia-tan? (0:16:12.28)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : How joyous! How embarrassing! How rare! (0:16:14.55)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : Say anything! Tell me to do anything! (0:16:16.66)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : For you, I'd dive into fire, water,
the loot house, anywhere! (0:16:18.79)
▶ Emilia : Subaru... (0:16:22.67)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : Hey, come on! The Emilia-tan
I know would say... (0:16:24.16)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : Wait! Are you a fake? (0:16:27.85)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : But could anyone else look so gorgeous
that I just want to hug her? (0:16:29.87)
▶ Emilia : All right. (0:16:35.17)
▶ Emilia : Subaru, come here. (0:16:36.61)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : Wha— (0:16:38.06)
▶ Emilia : Just come. (0:16:38.64)
▶ Emilia : Okay, sit here. (0:16:40.70)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : Can't I sit on the bed or a chair? Why the floor? (0:16:42.02)
▶ Emilia : Just sit! (0:16:46.14)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : Yes, ma'am! With pleasure! (0:16:47.29)
▶ Emilia : Just this once, all right? (0:17:01.66)
▶ Emilia : Your position is a little weird. (0:17:07.70)
▶ Emilia : And... It tickles. (0:17:09.65)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : You're letting me rest in your lap? (0:17:13.21)
▶ Emilia : Don't say it aloud! It's embarrassing! (0:17:14.88)
▶ Emilia : And no looking up here... (0:17:17.40)
▶ Emilia : Close your eyes. (0:17:20.05)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : You're adorable when you're embarrassed, but... (0:17:21.57)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : What's this about, anyway? (0:17:24.77)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : When did I do something worthy
of this kind of reward? (0:17:27.88)
▶ Emilia : You don't have to put on that
weird tough act now. (0:17:31.15)
▶ Emilia : Didn't you tell me to lend you my
lap when you were exhausted? (0:17:36.47)
▶ Emilia : I can't do this all the time, but today is special. (0:17:41.93)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : Special? It's only my second day. (0:17:45.79)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : If I'm already completely worn out,
what kind of weakling am I? (0:17:48.64)
▶ Emilia : It's plain to see that you're overwhelmed. (0:17:52.66)
▶ Emilia : You won't tell me what's
really going on, will you? (0:17:56.47)
▶ Emilia : I can't imagine this will make things any easier, (0:18:00.82)
▶ Emilia : but this is all I can do. (0:18:04.60)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : Emilia-tan, come on, now... (0:18:09.55)
▶ Emilia : Are you tired? (0:18:13.13)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : I'm totally fine. (0:18:14.57)
▶ Emilia : Are you troubled? (0:18:17.84)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : If you're this nice to me, I'm gonna
fall in love with you. (0:18:18.90)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : When you... I mean, like that... (0:18:22.48)
▶ Emilia : It's been rough, hasn't it? (0:18:26.29)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : It was rough... (0:18:37.52)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : It was so painful. (0:18:40.36)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : I was so scared. (0:18:42.41)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : I was so sad... (0:18:44.53)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : It hurt so much, I thought I'd die... (0:18:46.70)
▶ Emilia : Uh-huh. (0:18:49.91)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : I tried so hard. (0:18:50.92)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : I tried so hard! (0:18:53.07)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : I was so desperate... (0:18:55.06)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : So desperate to make everything right! (0:18:56.45)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : It's the truth. (0:19:01.52)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : I've honestly never tried so
hard at anything in my life! (0:19:02.91)
▶ Emilia : Uh-huh, I know. (0:19:08.19)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : Because I loved this place... (0:19:11.92)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : Because it was so important to me! (0:19:15.15)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : I was so desperate to get it back... (0:19:20.54)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : I was scared... I was so scared! (0:19:23.70)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : I didn't want those eyes looking
at me like that again... (0:19:27.69)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : And I hated myself so much
for feeling that way! (0:19:32.97)
▶ Rem : Subaru-kun? (0:19:43.92)
▶ Emilia : Shh. (0:19:45.85)
▶ Rem : Is Subaru-kun just asleep? (0:19:47.95)
▶ Emilia : Yes. (0:19:50.55)
▶ Emilia : He looks like a child, doesn't he? (0:19:52.88)
▶ Rem : It appears Subaru-kun cannot
do any more work today. (0:19:55.58)
▶ Emilia : Yes, he's done for today. (0:20:00.00)
▶ Emilia : What a bad boy, taking a day off,
on just his second day of work. (0:20:03.24)
▶ Rem : When he feels better, you can punish him. (0:20:07.88)
▶ Rem : Seeing him like this, I almost don't want to. (0:20:11.39)
▶ Emilia : Yeah. (0:20:16.16)
▶ Rem : I shall inform my sister that Subaru-kun
will be useless for today. (0:20:20.92)
▶ Emilia : Rem... (0:20:25.13)
▶ Emilia : Subaru is a good person. (0:20:27.11)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : Did I really just bawl all over the girl I love (0:20:38.63)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : and fall asleep, with tears and
snot all over my face? (0:20:41.60)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : What kind of shame play is that?!
I'm totally hopeless! (0:20:44.94)
▶ Beatrice : You burst in here late at night,
and that's what you say, I suppose? (0:20:48.80)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : Don't say that, Beako... We're tight, aren't we? (0:20:52.22)
▶ Beatrice : What kind of relationship do you think we— (0:20:55.72)
▶ Beatrice : Wait, what did you just call me? (0:20:58.60)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : Oh... "Beako"? (0:21:01.45)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : I think pet names are indispensable
in showing affection. (0:21:03.20)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : So I'm gonna call you Beako. (0:21:07.19)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : That's the best proof of my
affection that I can give. (0:21:09.68)
▶ Beatrice : What sort of obtrusive display
of goodwill is that? (0:21:12.45)
▶ Beatrice : That isn't just disgusting. It's revolting, hmph! (0:21:15.12)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : Don't be so cold, Beako! (0:21:17.84)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : The thing is... (0:21:21.16)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : I'm backed into a corner here. (0:21:24.04)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : Honestly, I want your help with
the curses I asked about. (0:21:26.40)
▶ Beatrice : I told you that, once activated,
curses can't be undone, I suppose. (0:21:29.13)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : Yeah, you did. (0:21:32.30)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : But can you detect curses before
they're activated instead? (0:21:33.86)
▶ Beatrice : I am capable of discovering curses
before they're activated. (0:21:37.88)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : How are curses placed? (0:21:43.80)
▶ Beatrice : There is one rule of casting curses
that cannot be broken, I suppose. (0:21:46.43)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : A rule that can't be broken? (0:21:50.49)
▶ Beatrice : Physical contact with the curse's target. (0:21:53.17)
▶ Beatrice : That is the prerequisite. (0:21:56.03)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : Other than those in this mansion, (0:21:59.04)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : I've only touched the villagers
at the base of the mountain. (0:22:01.23)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : I was cursed in the village, (0:22:04.81)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : it activated that night, in the mansion, (0:22:06.70)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : and then I died? (0:22:08.46)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : That would explain why the shaman
got Rem last time. (0:22:11.16)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : I didn't go to the village, so she
ended up being the target. (0:22:15.24)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : It fits... It all fits now! (0:22:19.68)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : I've finally found a lead, (0:22:22.91)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : damn it! (0:22:24.88)
▶ Beatrice : Is that any attitude to take toward someone
you asked for help, I suppose? (0:22:27.14)
▶ Beatrice : If it was helpful to you, I think
there's something you should say. (0:22:31.05)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : Yeah, that's right! (0:22:34.87)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : You saved me! Thanks to you,
I can see the light! (0:22:36.84)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : Beako, I love you! (0:22:40.15)
▶ Beatrice : Let me— (0:22:41.15)
▶ Beatrice : Put me down, I suppose! (0:22:43.25)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : Dorowazu! (0:22:44.71)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : And so, a lot's happened, (0:22:50.97)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : but today is a fresh start! I'm a new me! (0:22:52.86)
▶ Rem : The lap pillow, right? (0:22:55.26)
▶ Ram : It was the lap pillow. (0:22:56.68)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : Huh? (0:22:58.83)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : Wait, you guys knew? (0:22:59.61)
▶ Emilia : Subaru, good morning. (0:23:02.32)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : Emilia-tan? (0:23:03.56)
▶ Emilia : Um, this is kind of embarrassing... (0:23:06.12)
▶ Emilia : Are you feeling okay? (0:23:11.40)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : I wasn't so sure till I heard
your voice just now, but... (0:23:13.07)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : I'm okay now. (0:23:19.58)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : So, um, listen... (0:23:21.36)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : I'm sorr— (0:23:23.80)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : I mean, thanks for everything. (0:23:27.69)
▶ Emilia : You're welcome. (0:23:32.02)
▶ Rem : Well, shall we start on this
morning's work, Subaru-kun? (0:23:36.24)
▶ Ram : We need to begin our morning duties. (0:23:39.39)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : Before that, I have a favor to ask. (0:23:42.27)
▶ Rem : A lap pillow, right? (0:23:45.68)
▶ Ram : It's a lap pillow. (0:23:46.70)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : I'm not that unscrupulous! (0:23:47.60)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : Actually, I want to go to the village. (0:23:49.44)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : It's not far, right? (0:23:51.71)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : Do we have any plans to shop for anything? (0:23:53.45)
▶ Rem : If I recall, we are low on seasonings, (0:23:56.10)
▶ Rem : so I was thinking of going
to the village tomorrow. (0:23:58.75)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : Then why don't we go today instead? (0:24:01.46)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : If we're running low, it never
hurts to restock sooner! (0:24:03.82)
▶ Ram : I don't see a problem with that. (0:24:08.97)
▶ Rem : Sister... (0:24:10.80)
▶ Ram : You do need to go shopping, and we
have no urgent duties. (0:24:11.88)
▶ Ram : And you have Barusu to carry your packages. (0:24:15.34)
▶ Rem : If you say so, Sister. (0:24:18.55)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : All right! (0:24:20.33)
▶ Ram : But I'm going with you. (0:24:22.24)
▶ Ram : You'll have a pretty flower on each arm, Barusu. (0:24:24.94)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : Huh? (0:24:27.38)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : Uh, I just hope those
flowers aren't poisonous... (0:24:28.44)
▶ EXTRA : I Cried, My Lungs Out,
and Stopped Crying (0:24:32.82)▶ Subaru Natsuki : And now for the final exercise! (0:00:13.11)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : Swing your arms out wide, (0:00:15.71)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : then cross them in front of you
as you take slow, deep breaths. (0:00:17.82)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : In... And out... (0:00:21.54)
▶ Ram : I came to check on you since
break time's almost over. (0:00:22.20)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : In... And out... (0:00:24.33)
▶ Rem : Things are quite lively. (0:00:25.67)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : Okay, finally... (0:00:27.75)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : Victory! (0:00:29.21)
▶ EXTRA : Victory! (0:00:30.90)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : All right! (0:00:35.38)
▶ EXTRA : Yeah! (0:00:36.42)
▶ EXTRA : I feel so much younger. (0:00:39.77)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : Okay, everyone has touched me now. (0:00:48.79)
▶ Ram : Barusu... (0:00:51.87)
▶ Ram : What sort of game is this? (0:00:53.60)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : Radio calisthenics. (0:00:55.10)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : I think the fact that everyone,
young and old, can enjoy it (0:00:57.05)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : is the secret to its many long years of success! (0:01:00.45)
▶ Ram : Who cares? (0:01:03.24)
▶ EXTRA : Ram-chi, that was cold. (0:01:04.75)
▶ EXTRA : Ram-chi, that was mean. (0:01:06.28)
▶ EXTRA : Ram-chi, you're scary. (0:01:07.54)
▶ Ram : Did you teach these children to call me that? (0:01:11.45)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : Well, it was more like... (0:01:13.83)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : I wanted to spread some friendliness around? (0:01:15.65)
▶ Ram : I don't mind, but what about Rem? (0:01:19.56)
▶ EXTRA : Rem-rin? (0:01:23.02)
▶ EXTRA : Rem-rin? (0:01:24.00)
▶ EXTRA : Rem-rin-rin? (0:01:24.90)
▶ Ram : And? Did you enjoy the village
trip you wanted so much? (0:01:29.30)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : Nothing to worry about there. (0:01:32.26)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : When Muraosa patted my shoulder at
the end, my trip was complete. (0:01:34.77)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : What's up? (0:01:39.95)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : If you wanna say something, out with it. (0:01:41.12)
▶ EXTRA : U-Um... (0:01:43.12)
▶ EXTRA : Over there. (0:01:45.31)
▶ Ram : Have your way a bit longer. (0:01:51.54)
▶ Rem : If you say so, Sister. (0:01:53.78)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : All right! I owe you both, Senpai! (0:01:55.77)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : That's right, there was an event like this, too. (0:02:09.31)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : And this still happens? (0:02:14.97)
▶ EXTRA : She's usually so tame. (0:02:16.80)
▶ EXTRA : She only gets mad at Subaru. (0:02:18.62)
▶ EXTRA : What'd you do to her, Subaru? (0:02:20.68)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : That's what I'd like to know. (0:02:22.79)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : If it's happened three times,
I guess we're just incompatible... (0:02:25.57)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : Oh, now's my chance! (0:02:29.60)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : If you'll excuse me... (0:02:30.99)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : There's the sensation I've longed to feel! (0:02:35.73)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : Nice! For a stray, this is great! (0:02:37.66)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : Hey, you have a bald spot on your head. (0:02:40.94)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : A scar? What did you walk int— (0:02:43.87)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : Yow! (0:02:45.93)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : You even bit me in nearly the same spot... (0:02:48.15)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : Are you a time traveler? (0:02:50.58)
▶ EXTRA : You got carried away! (0:02:54.16)
▶ EXTRA : It's what you get for touching her so much. (0:02:55.78)
▶ EXTRA : She is a girl, after all. (0:02:57.83)
▶ EXTRA : I don't think that's quite the problem here. (0:02:59.57)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : Also, no one's worried about me? (0:03:02.23)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : I'm gonna cry! (0:03:04.38)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : I made it... I made it! (0:03:08.54)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : Well done, me! Good job! (0:03:10.88)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : Seriously, good job! (0:03:12.38)
▶ Rem : Yes, yes, well done. (0:03:14.05)
▶ Ram : Yes, yes, good work. (0:03:15.83)
▶ Roswaal L. Mathers : Ah, I see the three of you are together. (0:03:17.51)
▶ Roswaal L. Mathers : That will save me some time. (0:03:21.44)
▶ Rem : Roswaal-sama. (0:03:23.98)
▶ Ram : Roswaal-sama. (0:03:23.98)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : Formal clothes? (0:03:25.56)
▶ Roswaal L. Mathers : Well spotted. (0:03:28.24)
▶ Roswaal L. Mathers : I'm seeing someone who's a hassle
to deal with in normal attire, (0:03:30.04)
▶ Roswaal L. Mathers : so I had no choice but to wear dress clothes. (0:03:34.32)
▶ Rem : A visitor? (0:03:37.68)
▶ Ram : You're going out? (0:03:38.99)
▶ Roswaal L. Mathers : Ram is correct. I'm going out. (0:03:40.31)
▶ Roswaal L. Mathers : I received a message that
was a tad troublesome... (0:03:43.28)
▶ Roswaal L. Mathers : So I'm off to make the rounds outside. (0:03:47.52)
▶ Roswaal L. Mathers : I do not expect to be home tonight. (0:03:49.87)
▶ Roswaal L. Mathers : So, Ram and Rem, take care of things. (0:03:53.64)
▶ Ram : Yes, sir. As you command. (0:03:56.24)
▶ Rem : Yes, sir. Even if it costs our lives. (0:03:58.13)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : Roswaal didn't leave the mansion before... (0:04:00.96)
▶ Roswaal L. Mathers : I'll also be counting on you, Subaru-kun. (0:04:05.27)
▶ Roswaal L. Mathers : Take good care of Emilia-sama. (0:04:08.34)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : Sure, you can definitely count on me for that! (0:04:12.79)
▶ Roswaal L. Mathers : Then, look after things while I'm away. (0:04:15.80)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : H-He can fly? (0:04:19.84)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : Magic is incredible... (0:04:26.12)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : The difference in circumstances (0:04:30.03)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : must have been triggered
by my visit to the village. (0:04:32.04)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : That means my strategy of acting
as a decoy is working as planned. (0:04:36.54)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : And that's why I'm here for my
long-awaited Beako time! (0:04:43.32)
▶ Beatrice : Your face looks quite different
than it did half a day ago. (0:04:46.84)
▶ Beatrice : You've been busy, I suppose. (0:04:49.90)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : I'd love to take it easy for a change, you know... (0:04:51.52)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : But there's something I want
you to check out for me. (0:04:54.18)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : I think I've been cursed.
Could you find out for sure? (0:04:58.87)
▶ Beatrice : What are you talking about? (0:05:02.88)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : I think I've been cursed.
Could you find out for sure? (0:05:04.48)
▶ Beatrice : No one asked you to repeat yourself, I suppose! (0:05:07.66)
▶ Beatrice : It's only been half a day since
I told you about shamans. (0:05:11.07)
▶ Beatrice : You're far too impressionabl— (0:05:14.63)
▶ Beatrice : Traces of a curse... (0:05:17.10)
▶ Beatrice : You really have been cursed, I suppose? (0:05:19.32)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : So the shaman was one
of the villagers, after all. (0:05:21.77)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : Can you tell what kind of curse it is? (0:05:25.95)
▶ Beatrice : I can't say just from looking at the curse. (0:05:28.32)
▶ Beatrice : But as I told you, once it's activated, (0:05:31.58)
▶ Beatrice : chances are you'll die, I suppose. (0:05:34.98)
▶ Beatrice : You don't seem to be afraid of dying at all. (0:05:38.91)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : Huh? Are you nuts? (0:05:42.93)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : I'm insanely scared of dying! (0:05:44.63)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : There's nothing in the world that
scares me more than dying. (0:05:46.62)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : I wish people who say "I'd rather die"
would actually die before they say it. (0:05:50.12)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : That's why, this time, I'll find a way out... (0:05:54.50)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : of this fate. (0:05:58.78)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : Okay, so get rid of this curse for me, would you? (0:06:00.81)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : I don't have much time. (0:06:03.68)
▶ Beatrice : Why should I have to save your life, I suppose? (0:06:05.10)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : I expected an unlovable response like that, (0:06:08.83)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : so I came prepared to convince you. (0:06:11.37)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : If I die, Puck is bound to be sad. (0:06:14.13)
▶ Beatrice : Huh? (0:06:17.87)
▶ Beatrice : Bubby wouldn't be all that disturbed if you died. (0:06:18.95)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : Oh, no... (0:06:23.49)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : If I were to die, Emilia would
be at least a little shocked. (0:06:24.54)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : When Emilia feels shock,
Puck takes damage, too. (0:06:27.78)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : And if you could have stopped it,
but didn't, what would he think of you? (0:06:30.80)
▶ Beatrice : I'll go along with your smooth
talk this time, I suppose! (0:06:36.03)
▶ Beatrice : But after this, I'll have nothing
more to do with you again. (0:06:39.08)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : Sure. (0:06:42.91)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : But when I'm in trouble,
I'll always come to ask for your help. (0:06:44.04)
▶ Beatrice : I'll destroy the spell used in
the curse now, I suppose. (0:06:49.65)
▶ Beatrice : The spell is burned into you on the
spot that the shaman touched, (0:06:53.70)
▶ Beatrice : so that's our reference. (0:06:57.94)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : I prepared for this. Don't worry. (0:06:59.42)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : The young men's leader with the crew cut... (0:07:02.92)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : The old lady who felt so much younger
that she patted my butt... (0:07:04.70)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : And Muraosa, the fake village head. (0:07:07.24)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : I made sure all the suspects
touched different parts of me. (0:07:09.22)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : A black mist? (0:07:24.65)
▶ Beatrice : How abhorrent, I suppose. (0:07:26.94)
▶ Beatrice : All done. You'll be fine now, I suppose. (0:07:31.36)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : So the place that the black mist came from (0:07:36.99)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : is where the shaman touched me, right? (0:07:39.76)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : Could that puppy actually be... (0:07:46.40)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : I have to get to the village. (0:07:49.98)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : They just keep messing with me! (0:07:51.92)
▶ Ram : The village? What for? (0:07:57.76)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : Beatrice said the one who gave me this
wound is responsible for cursing me. (0:08:00.19)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : It was the dog that the kids were playing with! (0:08:05.33)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : That dog-looking thing cursed everyone it bit! (0:08:09.35)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : If I do nothing, they'll be in danger. (0:08:13.18)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : If you don't trust me, you can come along. (0:08:16.78)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : But we can't leave Emilia alone here. (0:08:19.45)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : Only one of you can come! (0:08:22.40)
▶ Rem : You're making up your own rules... (0:08:24.69)
▶ Rem : And if we are to obey Roswaal-sama's orders, (0:08:26.54)
▶ Rem : there is no reason for either
of us to go with you. (0:08:29.55)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : No, there's not. (0:08:32.44)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : But was that the only order Roswaal gave me? (0:08:34.08)
▶ Ram : Very well, Barusu. (0:08:39.33)
▶ Ram : I'll allow you to act on your judgment. (0:08:41.21)
▶ Rem : Sister... (0:08:43.43)
▶ Ram : Rem will accompany you. (0:08:44.80)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : Just what I wanted to hear! (0:08:46.45)
▶ Ram : Rem, that's my decision, so please go. (0:08:48.60)
▶ Ram : I'll confirm with Beatrice-sama
and protect Emilia-sama. (0:08:51.29)
▶ Ram : I'll keep an eye on that, too. (0:08:55.72)
▶ Rem : Sister, you shouldn't... (0:08:57.98)
▶ Emilia : Subaru, are you going somewhere? (0:08:59.90)
▶ Emilia : I heard loud voices, so I came down
to see what was going on... (0:09:02.16)
▶ Emilia : What happened? (0:09:05.50)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : Something might be happening. (0:09:06.64)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : But you don't need to worry. (0:09:09.15)
▶ Emilia : You look like you're going to do
something dangerous again! (0:09:11.14)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : We were just wrapping up a dispute
on that particular topic. (0:09:13.64)
▶ Emilia : I can't stop you, can I? (0:09:18.20)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : I guess not, no. (0:09:19.87)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : In fact, if you do, it'd be a
hindrance in several ways... (0:09:22.74)
▶ Emilia : Fine, fine, I get it. (0:09:28.30)
▶ Emilia : I won't stop you. (0:09:30.85)
▶ Emilia : It's probably no use telling you not
to be rash or reckless, too, right? (0:09:32.26)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : Depending on what happens... (0:09:36.14)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : I mean, it's not like I want to do any of that. (0:09:38.37)
▶ Emilia : May the blessing of the spirits be with you. (0:09:43.51)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : Eh? Say what? (0:09:47.33)
▶ Emilia : It's a prayer to send you off.
It means "come back safely." (0:09:49.88)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : Got it, Emilia-tan. (0:09:55.05)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : Okay, I'm off. (0:09:58.96)
▶ Emilia : Take care. (0:10:00.56)
▶ Rem : Has something happened? (0:10:16.21)
▶ EXTRA : Y-Yeah... Several of the village
children have gone missing. (0:10:17.72)
▶ EXTRA : All the adults are looking for them. (0:10:21.52)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : Was I too late? (0:10:24.18)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : There! (0:10:28.69)
▶ Rem : Subaru-kun? (0:10:30.26)
▶ Rem : The barrier is broken. (0:10:45.89)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : What happens when the barrier's broken? (0:10:48.34)
▶ Rem : Mabeasts can cross the boundary. (0:10:50.86)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : Mabeasts? (0:10:53.42)
▶ Rem : Mabeasts are creatures of the witch's creation. (0:10:54.78)
▶ Rem : They're enemies of humanity
that have magic powers. (0:10:57.71)
▶ Rem : They live gregariously in the forest. (0:11:00.64)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : Gregariously? (0:11:03.10)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : You mean tons more dogs
like that one are out there? (0:11:05.23)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : The kids are in the forest. (0:11:11.74)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : Tell everyone! (0:11:14.05)
▶ EXTRA : Right! (0:11:16.06)
▶ Rem : Subaru-kun, what are you... (0:11:20.42)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : I have to go save those kids! (0:11:22.31)
▶ Rem : Wait! You can't make that decision on your own. (0:11:24.26)
▶ Rem : With Roswaal-sama away from home, (0:11:27.67)
▶ Rem : can you be sure that this isn't a ruse to
divert attention from the mansion? (0:11:30.51)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : What do we do, then? (0:11:34.06)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : Ignore kids who are in trouble right now, (0:11:35.84)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : go back to the mansion, and tighten security? (0:11:38.55)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : If you won't care when all the
villagers are dead tomorrow, (0:11:40.89)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : I guess that's an option. (0:11:43.92)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : Rem, let's go. We're the only ones
who can do something about this. (0:11:46.88)
▶ Rem : Why go so far? (0:11:51.35)
▶ Rem : Why should this village matter to you? (0:11:53.75)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : You know, Petra... (0:11:56.16)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : When she grows up, she wants to
make clothes in the capital. (0:11:57.65)
▶ Rem : Huh? (0:12:01.40)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : Lucas wants to succeed the
village's best woodcutter. (0:12:02.78)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : Mildo wants to make a crown
from the flowers in the fields, (0:12:07.04)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : and give it to his mother. (0:12:10.35)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : Meina is going to have a baby sister soon. (0:12:13.35)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : And the brothers, Dyne and Cain, are
always fighting over who'll marry Petra. (0:12:16.60)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : They do matter to me. (0:12:26.16)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : I know their names, their faces, (0:12:28.41)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : and what they want to do in the future. (0:12:30.76)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : And I promised them we'd do radio
calisthenics again tomorrow. (0:12:33.56)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : I keep my promises, and I make
sure others keep theirs. (0:12:38.63)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : I'm going to do radio calisthenics
with those kids again. (0:12:42.97)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : So I'm going in there. (0:12:47.43)
▶ Rem : Very well. (0:12:53.44)
▶ Rem : My orders were to keep an eye on you. (0:12:56.00)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : Yeah, that's right. (0:13:00.55)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : Make sure I don't do anything shady! (0:13:02.29)
▶ Rem : I will. (0:13:08.10)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : Um, Rem-san, is that... (0:13:14.03)
▶ Rem : It's for protection. (0:13:16.05)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : But that's... (0:13:17.17)
▶ Rem : It's for protection. (0:13:18.61)
▶ Rem : We're close. I smell something alive. (0:13:31.87)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : The kids? (0:13:34.62)
▶ Rem : I'm not sure, but it doesn't smell like animals. (0:13:35.71)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : It's the kids! (0:13:50.95)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : She's alive. (0:13:55.98)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : They're alive! (0:13:56.94)
▶ Rem : No, they're still breathing now, (0:13:58.04)
▶ Rem : but they are very weak. (0:14:00.35)
▶ Rem : If left alone... (0:14:02.10)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : Weak... The curse? (0:14:03.20)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : And we finally found them... (0:14:08.07)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : Rem, can't you undo it? (0:14:10.31)
▶ Rem : I lack the skill for this. (0:14:12.51)
▶ Rem : If only my sister were here to see them... (0:14:14.56)
▶ Rem : But I will cast a healing spell to comfort them. (0:14:17.76)
▶ Rem : When they're calm, we'll carry them back. (0:14:21.10)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : Okay, I'll... (0:14:24.97)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : Damn, I'm so useless. (0:14:27.07)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : I'll keep watch— (0:14:29.64)
▶ EXTRA : Subaru? (0:14:30.47)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : You're awake, Petra? (0:14:32.14)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : All right, good. You're a tough girl. (0:14:34.20)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : Don't overdo it, though. (0:14:36.80)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : I'll take you back home, where you
can say goodbye to the pain. (0:14:38.48)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : Just rest for— (0:14:41.90)
▶ EXTRA : One is... (0:14:42.30)
▶ EXTRA : still... in the... (0:14:44.00)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : Hey, what'd you say? Petra! (0:14:48.48)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : Damn it, she's right. I don't
see the little girl with the braid! (0:14:54.02)
▶ Rem : P-Please, wait! It's too dangerous. (0:14:57.97)
▶ Rem : And if the mabeasts took her, it's already... (0:15:00.80)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : I get what you're saying! I do! (0:15:03.28)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : But, Rem... (0:15:06.44)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : Petra says another girl was taken away. (0:15:08.07)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : She showed concern for her friend
before asking for my help. (0:15:12.08)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : She put her friend before herself! (0:15:16.54)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : I want to respect Petra's feelings. (0:15:21.65)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : If you take something on, you should
make the effort to take it all on. (0:15:24.00)
▶ Rem : If you get too greedy, (0:15:27.80)
▶ Rem : you might take on more
than you can carry back. (0:15:29.15)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : That's why you're with me, isn't it? (0:15:33.76)
▶ Rem : What does that have to do with me? (0:15:36.65)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : Those kids need you now. (0:15:38.93)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : When the villagers show up, (0:15:42.29)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : leave the kids with them and follow me. (0:15:43.80)
▶ Rem : We don't know the threat our opponent
presents, or when the villagers will arrive. (0:15:47.54)
▶ Rem : And at worst, there is a chance
I won't be able to find you. (0:15:52.06)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : It'll be fine. You won't lose me. (0:15:55.60)
▶ Rem : What makes you so sure? (0:15:58.97)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : Even if no one else does,
you can pick up my scent. (0:16:00.50)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : The foul odor that hangs on me... (0:16:05.51)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : The smell of the witch. (0:16:07.86)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : Right? (0:16:09.86)
▶ Rem : Subaru-kun, how much do you know about... (0:16:11.34)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : No idea... There's a ton I don't understand. (0:16:13.74)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : So much that no matter how
many times I start over, (0:16:17.21)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : I can't find the answer I'm looking for. (0:16:20.42)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : Just like there are things you want to ask me, (0:16:24.94)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : there are tons of things I want to ask you. (0:16:27.66)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : So when this is all taken care of, let's talk. (0:16:31.08)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : Until our voices are hoarse! Promise? (0:16:33.69)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : I trust you, Rem. (0:16:40.08)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : So I want to act in a way
that makes you trust me. (0:16:42.53)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : I'll make that promise right now! (0:16:45.72)
▶ Rem : Very well. The promise is made. (0:16:50.02)
▶ Rem : I will ask you many questions, so be ready. (0:16:54.02)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : Sure! (0:16:56.97)
▶ Rem : Once the villagers come for
the kids, I'll come join you. (0:16:58.21)
▶ Rem : Don't do anything reckless. (0:17:01.97)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : Don't worry! I'm fanatical like a demon today! (0:17:04.09)
▶ Rem : Fanatical... like a demon? (0:17:08.96)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : It's the demon version of divine possession. (0:17:10.91)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : It's my favorite phrase lately! (0:17:12.85)
▶ Rem : Please be careful. (0:17:16.32)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : If the one that cursed those kids
really was that dog from today, (0:17:24.85)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : there's no way I can lose, right? (0:17:29.55)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : I smell animals. (0:17:34.09)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : Is it a trap? (0:17:46.82)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : Emilia wouldn't hesitate! (0:17:51.84)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : Thank goodness... (0:18:03.82)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : This is not what we discussed! (0:18:19.39)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : Why is it so huge? (0:18:21.90)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : And was it waiting for me to come for her? (0:18:24.44)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : Nowhere to run... (0:18:29.28)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : Damn it! If you wanna fight, bring it on! (0:18:34.13)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : That... (0:18:48.84)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : doesn't hurt! (0:18:50.08)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : You just bit me, didn't you, you moron?! (0:18:52.94)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : I won... (0:19:14.44)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : You've gotta be kidding me... (0:19:23.74)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : If you wanna fight, bring it on! (0:19:29.62)
▶ Rem : The children have been safely
returned to the village. (0:19:41.55)
▶ Rem : Thank you for buying time. (0:19:44.91)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : Rem, watch ou— (0:19:48.54)
▶ Rem : Shh. (0:19:50.08)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : Y-You're strong! (0:19:54.58)
▶ Rem : I'm not sure if that's a nice thing
to say to a girl, Subaru-kun. (0:19:57.03)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : I have no other words to describe you! (0:20:01.56)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : You're seriously incredible! (0:20:04.65)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : So, Rem, would you be able to take them
all out in one shot, by chance? (0:20:09.26)
▶ Rem : We are outnumbered. With this
many, our situation is dire. (0:20:13.35)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : Yeah, I guess it would be. (0:20:16.40)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : In that case... There! (0:20:18.26)
▶ Rem : Now! (0:20:21.35)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : Rem, I don't know the way! (0:20:41.92)
▶ Rem : Straight ahead. (0:20:43.82)
▶ Rem : Once we cross the barrier, the battle will end. (0:20:45.52)
▶ Rem : Run toward the village bonfire! (0:20:47.79)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : Got it! (0:20:49.34)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : Rem, I see light! (0:21:02.42)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : We're almost to the barrier! (0:21:03.98)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : Rem? (0:21:23.75)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : Damn it... (0:21:41.36)
▶ Rem : Mabeast! Mabeast! Mabeast! Mabeast! (0:22:18.01)
▶ Rem : Witch! (0:22:20.61)
▶ Rem : Mabeast! Mabeast! Mabeast! Mabeast! (0:22:22.08)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : She's a demon... (0:22:33.76)
▶ Rem : Subaru-kun! (0:22:53.76)
▶ Rem : Don't die... (0:22:58.64)
▶ Rem : Don't die! Don't die! (0:23:00.11)
▶ Rem : Don't die! (0:23:02.36)
EXTRA : The Meaning of Courage (0:23:02.36b)▶ Rem : ...to give up? (0:00:14.03)
▶ Rem : Is there no other way to save... (0:00:16.04)
▶ Beatrice : ...all, I suppose. (0:00:18.63)
▶ Beatrice : You can do as you like with him now. (0:00:20.17)
▶ Rem : I swear... (0:00:27.42)
▶ Rem : I'll save you. (0:00:29.36)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : Another unfamiliar ceiling. (0:00:36.32)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : Ow! (0:00:39.58)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : So they barely managed to save my life, (0:00:45.55)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : and these are the scars... (0:00:47.50)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : Emilia... (0:00:58.41)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : I guess now I owe her yet another debt. (0:01:01.38)
▶ Puck : I don't know about that. (0:01:05.20)
▶ Puck : This time, you produced results
equal to the effort invested, (0:01:07.85)
▶ Puck : so I doubt Lia will think of it as a debt. (0:01:11.55)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : Puck... (0:01:15.00)
▶ Puck : Good morning, Subaru. (0:01:16.00)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : You say these are results equal to my effort,
but I don't remember anything (0:01:17.88)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : after I got nommed on by
those dogs in the forest. (0:01:22.15)
▶ Puck : "Nommed on"? That's a cute way to put it. (0:01:24.77)
▶ Puck : But it was actually... (0:01:27.64)
▶ Puck : Munch, gobble, snarf, chew,
chomp, snap, crunch! (0:01:29.16)
▶ Puck : More like that. (0:01:33.00)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : With all those sound effects,
I should definitely be dead now. (0:01:34.86)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : I think I'm five or six arms short for all that. (0:01:38.14)
▶ Puck : Yeah, the blue-haired maid took
care of the rest of the damage. (0:01:40.73)
▶ Puck : She was in awful shape. (0:01:44.20)
▶ Puck : Though she heals fast, thanks to
her demon transformation. (0:01:46.48)
▶ Puck : By the time she carried you
back to the village, (0:01:51.09)
▶ Puck : she had no visible injuries. (0:01:53.41)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : Don't scare me for no reason... (0:01:56.22)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : Anyway, Rem went back to the village? (0:01:58.63)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : And what about the kids? (0:02:01.53)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : Was the curse removed? (0:02:03.16)
▶ Puck : No worries there. (0:02:05.02)
▶ Puck : Betty and I took care of it, so all's well! (0:02:06.33)
▶ Puck : Your judgment was right on the mark! (0:02:09.53)
▶ Puck : Clap, clap, clap. (0:02:12.14)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : Has Emilia been here all night? (0:02:14.43)
▶ Puck : Yeah. (0:02:16.62)
▶ Puck : To heal you, (0:02:17.56)
▶ Puck : she drained her resources
right down to her odo, (0:02:19.19)
▶ Puck : so you should let her sleep. (0:02:22.29)
▶ Ram : Barusu, you're awake? (0:04:04.70)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : Ram... (0:04:06.86)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : Listen, uh... I mean, about Rem... (0:04:08.20)
▶ Ram : How shameful you are, (0:04:13.61)
▶ Ram : pestering others for food so soon
after being that badly injured. (0:04:15.68)
▶ Ram : Maybe some dog rubbed off
on you from the bites. (0:04:18.85)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : How the heck does some dog rub off? (0:04:21.13)
▶ Ram : Eat this. (0:04:23.66)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : Huh? (0:04:24.72)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : Sofubozu! (0:04:25.16)
▶ Ram : Delicious, isn't it? (0:04:30.29)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : I thought I was gonna die! (0:04:31.08)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : But yes, it was good! (0:04:32.66)
▶ Ram : It's freshly made. I mean... (0:04:34.43)
▶ Ram : Freshly steamed. (0:04:37.05)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : Why do you look so proud of yourself?! (0:04:38.04)
▶ Ram : Okay, okay. (0:04:40.43)
▶ Ram : You can have another, so be quiet and eat it. (0:04:41.31)
▶ Ram : And well... As for last night,
you have my honest thanks. (0:04:44.63)
▶ Ram : Nice work. (0:04:48.69)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : "Nice work"? Always with
the condescending tone. (0:04:50.17)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : Was it something deserving of your thanks? (0:04:53.82)
▶ Ram : When a domain's people suffer
any loss, its lord is held liable. (0:04:58.17)
▶ Ram : If that pack of ulgarm had further
endangered those children... (0:05:02.04)
▶ Ram : You were right to do as you did. (0:05:06.85)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : Ulgarm? (0:05:09.68)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : That's what those black mabeasts are called? (0:05:11.44)
▶ Ram : Yes, but it's all right. (0:05:13.48)
▶ Ram : I reconnected the broken barrier, (0:05:16.91)
▶ Ram : so the village is safe. (0:05:19.58)
▶ Ram : I kept an eye on the barrier overnight,
to ensure there were no problems. (0:05:30.57)
▶ Ram : No ulgarm should be able to cross
it and enter the village. (0:05:34.15)
▶ Ram : So you can relax. (0:05:38.01)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : Beako... (0:05:49.34)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : Hey! (0:05:51.08)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : I heard you helped remove
the curse from the kids. (0:05:52.08)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : Thanks. (0:05:54.64)
▶ Beatrice : No big deal. (0:05:55.59)
▶ Beatrice : Betty only helped because
Bubby asked, I suppose. (0:05:56.89)
▶ Beatrice : I have something more important to discuss. (0:06:01.42)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : What did you bring me all
the way out here to say? (0:06:09.73)
▶ Beatrice : In less than half a day, (0:06:16.02)
▶ Beatrice : you will die, I suppose. (0:06:18.28)
▶ Beatrice : You don't look as disturbed as I expected. (0:06:23.67)
▶ Beatrice : I thought you'd scream and cry, I suppose. (0:06:26.00)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : The curse still isn't lifted, then? (0:06:29.33)
▶ Beatrice : When the pack of mabeasts
attacked you in the forest, (0:06:32.93)
▶ Beatrice : they planted another curse deep inside you. (0:06:35.55)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : Can I ask why this one can't be removed? (0:06:38.45)
▶ Beatrice : That's simple, I suppose. (0:06:41.98)
▶ Beatrice : Too many curses have been placed on you,
making it too complex to remove. (0:06:43.70)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : Too many curses? (0:06:48.89)
▶ Beatrice : When there's only one, removing it
is as simple as untying a knot. (0:06:51.22)
▶ Beatrice : But the curses on you are a complex
web of many threads, (0:06:55.95)
▶ Beatrice : too tangled to undo. (0:07:00.52)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : Well, I get the idea that it's high in difficulty. (0:07:02.54)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : But why half a day? (0:07:05.24)
▶ Beatrice : After half a day, mabeasts replenish
mana by activating their spells. (0:07:07.03)
▶ Beatrice : The curse those mabeasts used drains
a target's mana, I suppose. (0:07:12.11)
▶ Beatrice : In other words, they made you mabeast food. (0:07:17.61)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : So they attack people because they're hungry? (0:07:22.40)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : That's a wild animal for you.
So simple-minded! (0:07:25.10)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : I guess we should be thankful they haven't
gotten hungry before now... (0:07:28.67)
▶ Beatrice : You... (0:07:32.84)
▶ Beatrice : You aren't even scared, I suppose? (0:07:35.16)
▶ Beatrice : I'm telling you how much time
you have left, you know. (0:07:37.23)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : Well, sure, I'm scared. (0:07:41.23)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : But I doubt you came here just
to tell me I'm going to die. (0:07:43.12)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : I don't think you're that mean. (0:07:47.05)
▶ Beatrice : What do you know about me, I suppose? (0:07:49.42)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : If nothing else, I feel I've known you
four times longer than I really have. (0:07:52.54)
▶ Beatrice : You make no sense! (0:07:57.25)
▶ Beatrice : But it's a fact that the chance for you
to be saved is much lower now. (0:08:00.23)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : Tell me... Just how low it is. (0:08:03.95)
▶ Beatrice : We're talking about eating
by means of a spell. (0:08:08.32)
▶ Beatrice : If the one that's eating dies, (0:08:11.53)
▶ Beatrice : logic says the meal would
be canceled, I suppose. (0:08:13.60)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : So that's it... (0:08:16.24)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : I just have to kill the things that cursed me. (0:08:18.24)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : But there are too many of them. (0:08:23.79)
▶ Beatrice : That's why Bubby hasn't told
that silly girl about the curse. (0:08:26.93)
▶ Emilia : Yeah, if Emilia knew, she'd definitely try
to do more than she's capable of... (0:08:31.44)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : Which makes me really happy, (0:08:35.48)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : but also really scared. (0:08:37.98)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : Man, the difficulty level
is seriously demonic! (0:08:39.85)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : This is just plain impossible. (0:08:41.85)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : I might as well give up— (0:08:43.81)
▶ Rem : So you're going to give up? (0:08:45.03)
▶ Rem : Is there no other way to save him? (0:08:47.07)
▶ Beatrice : His head must be hurting, I suppose. (0:08:50.25)
▶ Beatrice : That isn't surprising. (0:08:52.44)
▶ Beatrice : That's all, I suppose. (0:08:55.99)
▶ Beatrice : You can do as you like with him now. (0:08:57.66)
▶ Rem : I swear... I'll save you. (0:09:00.99)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : It can't be. (0:09:04.04)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : Where... is Rem? (0:09:06.88)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : Beako... Beatrice, where is Rem?! (0:09:09.95)
▶ Beatrice : In her position, what would
you do, I suppose? (0:09:13.52)
▶ Ram : I can't ignore what you just said. (0:09:18.11)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : Ram... (0:09:21.21)
▶ Ram : Beatrice-sama, (0:09:22.40)
▶ Ram : Rem didn't go to the forest alone, did she? (0:09:23.99)
▶ Rem : I... I have to do this alone. (0:09:29.16)
▶ Rem : No one else needs to get hurt anymore! (0:09:32.88)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : Why? (0:09:37.53)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : Why would Rem go to such lengths for me? (0:09:39.12)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : Hey, hold on! (0:09:43.53)
▶ Ram : Let go of me, Barusu! (0:09:45.15)
▶ Ram : Right now, I'm not calm enough to be kind! (0:09:46.97)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : If you want to save Rem, (0:09:49.78)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : and if you consider me an
ally at all, listen to me! (0:09:51.37)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : Do you know where Rem is? (0:09:55.06)
▶ Ram : If I use my clairvoyance, I will! (0:09:56.52)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : Clairvoyance? (0:09:58.85)
▶ Ram : It's a power that allows me to see (0:10:00.36)
▶ Ram : what the bugs and animals on
my wavelength are seeing. (0:10:02.72)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : Then they're like your security cameras? (0:10:06.04)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : Well, if we can use it to get to Rem, fine. (0:10:09.51)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : So, are you the kind of maid that fights? (0:10:13.05)
▶ Ram : What does that even mean? (0:10:17.36)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : It means I'm going to the forest with you. (0:10:19.76)
▶ Ram : You're going to follow me? (0:10:22.10)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : Yeah. I'm bound to slow you
down in a fight, you know. (0:10:23.29)
▶ Ram : If you expect that I can fight like Rem
does in her demon form, I can't. (0:10:28.17)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : You're twins, right? (0:10:32.01)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : If Rem is a demon, aren't you a demon, too? (0:10:33.80)
▶ Ram : Unlike Rem, I'm hornless. (0:10:39.85)
▶ Ram : I can only use a rather extreme
bit of wind magic. (0:10:46.13)
▶ Beatrice : Going to retrieve the younger sister (0:10:51.76)
▶ Beatrice : would mean giving up on your own life. (0:10:54.33)
▶ Beatrice : You do understand that, I suppose? (0:10:57.19)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : That's not quite right. Let me correct you. (0:11:00.47)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : Forming the habit of giving up because
you're used to dying is dumb. (0:11:03.77)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : Life is precious! You only get one! (0:11:07.03)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : When you guys went through so much
to save mine, I realized that. (0:11:09.55)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : So if you don't mind, I'm going
to struggle pathetically. (0:11:12.89)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : Let's go make a comeback! (0:11:16.35)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : I've bounced back from the
terrible state I was in. (0:11:18.89)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : I'm a greedy guy. (0:11:22.27)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : And I want to see this story's
continuation, with me in it. (0:11:24.48)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : Now, let's get moving to
our last big showdown! (0:11:28.44)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : Bring it on, Fate-sama! (0:11:32.43)
▶ Ram : You gave a pretty heroic speech back there. (0:11:40.56)
▶ Ram : But when I see you close to becoming
nothing but baggage, (0:11:43.69)
▶ Ram : it's difficult to hide my disappointment. (0:11:47.12)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : I'm still recovering, so my energy
is spent, and I'm low on blood... (0:11:49.50)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : Oh, and I didn't get to hear
Emilia-tan say, "See you soon." (0:11:54.38)
▶ Ram : Until you say, "I'm home," last night's
"See you soon" is still in effect. (0:11:59.26)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : I-Is that how it works? (0:12:03.69)
▶ Ram : Besides, didn't you get something from
someone other than Emilia-sama? (0:12:06.35)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : Yeah, something really awesome. (0:12:12.11)
▶ EXTRA : Take this. (0:12:16.69)
▶ EXTRA : It's the sharpest sword in the village. (0:12:18.41)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : Thanks, man. (0:12:20.41)
▶ EXTRA : We're counting on you. (0:12:21.61)
▶ EXTRA : Subaru! (0:12:22.52)
▶ EXTRA : Subaru! (0:12:24.41)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : Hey, you guys! You're awake? (0:12:25.48)
▶ EXTRA : Where are you going? (0:12:27.61)
▶ EXTRA : Back into the forest? (0:12:28.76)
▶ EXTRA : Don't go back there, Subaru! (0:12:30.30)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : I'll be fine. Don't worry. (0:12:32.25)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : I'm not going anywhere. (0:12:34.23)
▶ EXTRA : What's the sword for? (0:12:35.82)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : This? (0:12:37.59)
▶ EXTRA : It's a thank you gift from all of us. (0:12:38.47)
▶ EXTRA : I wanna thank you, too! (0:12:40.74)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : Hey! (0:12:41.86)
▶ EXTRA : You can have this! (0:12:42.54)
▶ EXTRA : And this! (0:12:43.10)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : Candy, a pretty stone... (0:12:49.47)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : And... (0:12:52.52)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : There was a freaking bug in it! (0:12:55.04)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : Damn brats, sneaking that
in while I was distracted! (0:12:57.07)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : I'll lecture them later! (0:13:00.03)
▶ Ram : It's just proof that they admire you. (0:13:01.80)
▶ Ram : I wonder what they see in a man like you. (0:13:03.63)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : In a child's pure eyes, (0:13:06.08)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : my true, manly nature shines... (0:13:08.07)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : Also, I'm not the only one they like. (0:13:11.28)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : You could tell, right? (0:13:14.05)
▶ Ram : Yes... (0:13:17.36)
▶ EXTRA : Take this, too! (0:13:19.33)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : Hey! Why did you put dirt in there? (0:13:20.51)
▶ EXTRA : Just accept it! (0:13:23.14)
▶ EXTRA : Ram-chi! (0:13:24.62)
▶ EXTRA : We also want to thank
Rem-rin, so bring her later! (0:13:28.09)
▶ EXTRA : Promise, Ram-chi! (0:13:32.60)
▶ Ram : Barusu, I'm going to use my clairvoyance. (0:13:39.79)
▶ Ram : Wait a moment. (0:13:42.08)
▶ Ram : Barusu, something is watching us right now. (0:14:01.67)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : What? (0:14:04.64)
▶ Ram : Up there. (0:14:05.71)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : Where? (0:14:06.41)
▶ Ram : More are coming. (0:14:09.93)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : Hey! D-Don't just walk off! (0:14:17.46)
▶ Ram : Anyway, why does every individual lose their head when they see you? (0:14:22.49)
▶ Ram : I don't understand. (0:14:28.11)
▶ Ram : Because you seem so weak? (0:14:32.90)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : After all that hesitation,
that's your conclusion? (0:14:34.40)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : How rude! (0:14:36.52)
▶ Ram : Then, perhaps it's because
you seem like a wimp. (0:14:37.78)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : That doesn't change the root
of what you're saying, Onee-sama! (0:14:39.25)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : Hey, can I ask what that "hornless"
thing you mentioned means? (0:14:46.07)
▶ Ram : Nothing special. (0:14:57.15)
▶ Ram : Just as it sounds, (0:14:58.61)
▶ Ram : it's another name for a foolish
demon that lost its horn. (0:14:59.96)
▶ Ram : I got into a bit of trouble
and lost my only horn. (0:15:04.02)
▶ Ram : Ever since, I've relied on Rem for everything. (0:15:08.77)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : I guess I shouldn't have asked, huh? (0:15:14.06)
▶ Ram : Why? (0:15:16.49)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : Well, I don't know how important horns
are to the race you call "demons," (0:15:17.38)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : but I assume it's a pretty serious problem. (0:15:22.83)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : I just thought asking about it
might have been insensitive. (0:15:25.50)
▶ Ram : Back then was one thing. But now,
things have calmed down. (0:15:29.93)
▶ Ram : By losing my horn, there are things
I've gained and lives I've saved. (0:15:33.42)
▶ Ram : I'm sure Rem doesn't feel
the same way, though. (0:15:37.10)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : Huh? (0:15:40.46)
▶ Ram : Originally, members of the
demon race had two horns, (0:15:42.16)
▶ Ram : but twins are born with just one horn each. (0:15:45.49)
▶ Ram : That's why twins are detested. (0:15:50.69)
▶ Ram : And it's customary to dispose of
them immediately after birth. (0:15:53.46)
▶ Ram : But Rem and I were allowed to live. (0:15:56.60)
▶ Ram : A demon's horns awaken its demon instincts, (0:15:59.15)
▶ Ram : allowing it to devour mana,
heightening combat ability. (0:16:02.80)
▶ Ram : But if one is reckless, (0:16:07.31)
▶ Ram : the recoil will leave one battered. (0:16:08.75)
▶ Ram : I don't want to see Rem like that. (0:16:17.62)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : Are you worried because you care for Rem? (0:16:20.56)
▶ Ram : Of course I am. (0:16:22.60)
▶ Ram : It's true that she is stronger than I am, (0:16:24.01)
▶ Ram : but that's no reason not to worry about her. (0:16:26.89)
▶ Ram : No matter what we're told to do,
she does it far better. (0:16:32.33)
▶ Ram : But I am her older sister. (0:16:35.49)
▶ Ram : I won't waver from that position. (0:16:38.22)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : Okay, I get it. (0:16:42.80)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : I've got an idea. (0:16:44.29)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : So don't worry. (0:16:46.25)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : We'll bring Rem back safe! (0:16:47.90)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : If my idea is right, they're sure to come. (0:16:52.15)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : They'll be drawn here by my attempt
to tell her about Return by Death. (0:16:55.26)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : Ram, the thing is, I can retur— (0:16:59.83)
▶ Ram : What's that? (0:17:04.41)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : I made a wager that brought
a bit of pain with it. (0:17:07.40)
▶ Ram : What did you do, Barusu? (0:17:11.39)
▶ Ram : The wind is erratic, and I
smell approaching beasts. (0:17:13.01)
▶ Ram : A lot of them... (0:17:15.92)
▶ Ram : And we haven't found Rem yet! (0:17:17.68)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : Well, don't worry. (0:17:19.52)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : I'm pretty sure we'll cross paths soon. (0:17:21.03)
▶ Ram : What makes you so sure? (0:17:23.81)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : Because of the witch's lingering scent! (0:17:25.48)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : Rem's goal is to hunt down
all the mabeasts, right? (0:17:29.64)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : The mabeasts will be drawn
to the witch's scent, (0:17:32.58)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : and come right to me. (0:17:35.24)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : Then Rem will have no choice
but to follow them toward me. (0:17:37.39)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : I call it "Operation:
Natsuki Subaru is the Bait"! (0:17:41.12)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : Okay, I'm gonna have to rely on
you to fight, so go for it... (0:17:47.98)
▶ Ram : When this is over, look objectively
at what you just said (0:17:52.43)
▶ Ram : until you wish you were dead! (0:17:56.16)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : This is what I get for believing you
when you said you could fight! (0:18:09.27)
▶ Ram : Well, I was fighting, wasn't I? (0:18:12.25)
▶ Ram : My strength just didn't hold out
as long as I thought it would... (0:18:15.23)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : Damn it! (0:18:18.76)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : Crap! (0:18:22.68)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : D-Damn it all! (0:18:26.16)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : We were almost dead meat... (0:18:34.64)
▶ Ram : If we fall, we'll both be in trouble. (0:18:38.54)
▶ Ram : Barusu, can you climb up? (0:18:41.85)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : I'd like to make it up by sheer willpower, (0:18:43.96)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : but the mabeasts waiting
there are a problem— (0:18:46.44)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : The sharpest sword! (0:18:50.01)
▶ Ram : El Fula! (0:18:52.52)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : That was close... (0:18:58.72)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : Seriously, Ram-sama had timing like Buddha... (0:19:00.94)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : Huh? Hey, Ram? (0:19:04.40)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : H-Hey! (0:19:07.41)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : Damn it. You can't be serious. (0:19:08.83)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : Shit, this timing couldn't be worse... (0:19:17.52)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : Rem! (0:19:27.50)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : Thank goodness you're alive! We're saved! (0:19:31.84)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : Damn it. (0:19:43.80)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : She can turn into a demon,
but she can't control it? (0:19:44.63)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : Hey, Rem! My name is Natsuki Subaru! (0:19:51.08)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : A completely useless trainee in odd jobs... (0:19:53.98)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : The Roswaal mansion's most promising servant! (0:19:55.81)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : I've always caused trouble for you and Ram, (0:19:58.12)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : but we've been friends at times, (0:20:00.24)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : and we've fought at times— (0:20:01.63)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : Trying to beat me to death while
I'm still talking is bad manners... (0:20:03.95)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : Now's my chance... (0:20:21.94)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : Damn, it's no use! I can't ignore her! (0:20:38.09)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : Take the plunge, Subaru. (0:20:40.68)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : Men are about guts,
and women are about beauty! (0:20:42.28)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : So... (0:20:45.42)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : Quit making that scary face,
and try to smile, Rem! (0:20:48.46)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : I can Return by— (0:20:51.02)
▶ Ram : Her horn... (0:21:07.95)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : You're awake? (0:21:08.67)
▶ Ram : That should have been the perfect moment. (0:21:10.32)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : You have good intuition, Onee-sama! (0:21:12.91)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : What about her horn? (0:21:15.53)
▶ Ram : It's the horn that's making Rem a demon. (0:21:17.00)
▶ Ram : One good, solid hit should
bring her back to normal. (0:21:20.11)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : You're sure? (0:21:23.34)
▶ Ram : I am. I think. I hope. (0:21:24.65)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : That's vague! (0:21:27.73)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : A hit to that one spot. (0:21:32.80)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : Doesn't it seem impossible? (0:21:34.78)
▶ Ram : Muster your wisdom and courage,
and do something. (0:21:36.22)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : I actually do have an idea for
something we could do, (0:21:38.81)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : but it'll make you mad. (0:21:42.67)
▶ Ram : If it'll bring my sister back to
her senses, I won't get mad. (0:21:45.22)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : Really? (0:21:49.06)
▶ Ram : Absolutely. (0:21:50.02)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : You swear to Ros-chi? (0:21:51.76)
▶ Ram : That's the most reckless name
you could have chosen. (0:21:53.76)
▶ Ram : Yes, I swear to Roswaal-sama. (0:21:57.87)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : All right! (0:22:00.76)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : Heave... (0:22:03.00)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : Ho! (0:22:05.34)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : I freaked out! (0:22:18.45)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : I didn't have the guts for that last step! (0:22:19.76)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : If I let this chance go by,
there won't be others! (0:22:44.54)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : Smile, Rem! (0:22:48.59)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : Today, I'm fanatical like a real demon! (0:22:51.71)
▶ EXTRA : Fanatical Like a Demon (0:23:00.81)▶ Setanta : To us of the demon clan, twins are taboo. (0:00:16.19)
▶ Temae : Please wait, Chief! (0:00:21.48)
▶ Setanta : No! To protect our pride as a race, (0:00:23.41)
▶ Setanta : we must dispose of them. (0:00:27.40)
▶ Setanta : Such is the demon clan's custom! (0:00:29.57)
▶ Setanta : It is our law! (0:00:32.00)
▶ Setanta : This child is... (0:01:03.60)
▶ Setanta : She is a true prodigy. (0:01:30.44)
▶ EXTRA : Such power, with only one horn! (0:01:33.03)
▶ EXTRA : If she'd had two horns... (0:01:35.78)
▶ Quark : Very good, Ram... (0:01:41.76)
▶ Temae : Rem, follow your sister's
example and work hard. (0:01:43.58)
▶ Quark : Don't worry. (0:01:46.51)
▶ Quark : One day, Rem will show us that
she has incredible power. (0:01:47.67)
▶ Temae : You're right. She is Ram's sister, after all. (0:01:51.03)
▶ Quark : We expect great things. (0:01:54.94)
▶ Ram ( Child ) : Don't worry. (0:02:16.41)
▶ Rem (Child) : Sissy... (0:02:19.67)
▶ Ram ( Child ) : Just be you, Rem. (0:02:21.23)
▶ Ram ( Child ) : You don't have to worry about what people say. (0:02:22.98)
▶ Rem (Child) : I can never match my sister in demon power. (0:02:46.02)
▶ Rem (Child) : Then... (0:02:49.69)
▶ Rem (Child) : Hey, Mom... (0:02:58.80)
▶ Temae : What is it, Rem? (0:03:01.51)
▶ Rem (Child) : I'll make dinner tomorrow. (0:03:03.58)
▶ Ram ( Child ) : What are you making for dinner? (0:03:08.88)
▶ Rem (Child) : Hmm... (0:03:11.16)
▶ Rem (Child) : Maybe a stir-fry with barbaro rabbit
meat and nuts from the forest trees. (0:03:12.27)
▶ Rem (Child) : And steamed tatoes! (0:03:16.56)
▶ Ram ( Child ) : I'll help you. (0:03:18.46)
▶ Rem (Child) : No, I'll be fine by myself. (0:03:20.00)
▶ Rem (Child) : Just watch me. (0:03:23.28)
▶ Rem (Child) : Now, I just need a barbaro rabbit. (0:03:32.75)
▶ Rem (Child) : Sissy! (0:04:04.93)
▶ Temae : I'm just so glad you're both all right. (0:04:14.42)
▶ Rem (Child) : Both... (0:04:17.92)
▶ Quark : Rem, don't go into the forest alone again. (0:04:19.83)
▶ Temae : You don't want to worry your sister. (0:04:23.04)
▶ Rem (Child) : Yes, I'm sorry. (0:04:25.47)
▶ Ram ( Child ) : Wait, don't forget about this. (0:04:29.49)
▶ Ram ( Child ) : The steamed tatoes Rem made are really good. (0:04:32.73)
▶ Ram ( Child ) : They have just the right amount of salt. (0:04:37.49)
▶ Quark : You're right! They are good! (0:04:39.71)
▶ Temae : I had no idea Rem could make
something so delicious! (0:04:42.75)
▶ Temae : That's enough, Rem. (0:04:57.84)
▶ Temae : I'm just happy both of you are all right. (0:05:00.57)
▶ Quark : Yes, we're so glad you're both safe. (0:05:04.36)
▶ Setanta : No, it would have been better
if only Ram had been safe. (0:05:08.23)
▶ EXTRA : That's right. (0:05:12.08)
▶ EXTRA : You said it. (0:05:13.69)
▶ Temae : Yes, if only that useless Rem had died... (0:05:16.72)
▶ Quark : It would have been best if only Ram had lived. (0:05:19.88)
▶ Ram ( Child ) : You were having a scary dream, weren't you? (0:05:45.17)
▶ Ram ( Child ) : You were moaning. (0:05:47.72)
▶ Rem (Child) : Sissy... (0:05:49.94)
▶ Ram ( Child ) : It's all right. I'm with you. (0:05:51.53)
▶ Ram ( Child ) : So you don't have to worry about anything. (0:05:54.76)
▶ Rem (Child) : Right, Sissy. (0:05:58.30)
▶ Rem (Child) : I love you! (0:06:01.97)
▶ Rem (Child) : My sister really is amazing. (0:06:05.46)
▶ Rem (Child) : I can't match her in anything. (0:06:07.83)
▶ Rem (Child) : In that case, I don't have
to do anything anymore. (0:06:10.17)
▶ Rem (Child) : I can just walk behind her. (0:06:14.01)
▶ Rem (Child) : Sissy? (0:06:26.28)
▶ Rem (Child) : Sissy! (0:07:02.19)
▶ Ram ( Child ) : Rem... I'm glad you're safe. (0:07:13.90)
▶ Rem (Child) : It finally broke off. (0:07:33.47)
▶ Rem : Because of me, (0:07:37.79)
▶ Rem : my sister's horn was broken. (0:07:39.96)
▶ Rem : And she lost her power. (0:07:42.39)
▶ Rem : From now on, I have to learn to
do all the things that Sissy... (0:07:44.82)
▶ Rem : That Sister could do. (0:07:48.92)
▶ Rem : This is what Sister would have done. (0:07:51.95)
▶ Rem : Sister is far more amazing. (0:07:53.99)
▶ Rem : Sister could do even more. (0:07:55.85)
▶ Rem : I only imitate what Sister could do. (0:07:58.00)
▶ Rem : If I cannot even do that satisfactorily, (0:08:00.99)
▶ Rem : I am worthless. (0:08:03.96)
▶ Roswaal L. Mathers : You're doing a fine job... (0:08:05.89)
▶ Rem : Many times, I heard those words back home. (0:08:08.08)
▶ Ram : Don't overdo it. (0:08:12.89)
▶ Rem : Even if I overdo everything,
it will never be enough. (0:08:14.47)
▶ Frederica Baumann : Why do you try so hard? (0:08:17.81)
▶ Rem : Why else? Because nothing I do is enough. (0:08:20.44)
▶ Rem : Why should I go on living? (0:08:24.43)
▶ Rem : All of this is my atonement for (0:08:26.56)
▶ Rem : what I thought on that fiery night. (0:08:30.75)
▶ Rem : What can I do to atone? (0:08:33.65)
▶ Rem : I shall risk my life to walk the path
that Sister would have walked, (0:08:36.18)
▶ Rem : the path I took from her. (0:08:40.28)
▶ Rem : Because I am inferior to her in every way. (0:08:43.04)
▶ Rem : I am nothing but a replacement. (0:08:47.04)
▶ Ram : Barusu, head to the right of
that broken tree ahead! (0:08:52.84)
▶ Ram : You're too slow! (0:08:55.31)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : Don't ask any more of me... (0:08:56.20)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : I'm running... as fast as I can! (0:08:58.08)
▶ Rem : Subaru-kun... What... (0:09:00.88)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : You're awake, Rem? (0:09:04.00)
▶ Ram : Thank goodness, Rem.
You really are a handful. (0:09:06.06)
▶ Ram : Fula! (0:09:11.44)
▶ Rem : Why... (0:09:20.89)
▶ Rem : Why didn't you just leave me alone? (0:09:23.32)
▶ Rem : For you and Sister to show up
makes it all pointless. (0:09:27.80)
▶ Rem : I have to do it by myself. (0:09:32.42)
▶ Rem : No one else needs to get hurt anymore... (0:09:34.56)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : Too late for that. (0:09:36.97)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : Ram and I are already torn to shreds,
maybe even more than you! (0:09:38.67)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : My right shoulder's dislocated! (0:09:41.96)
▶ Rem : It's... It's my fault. (0:09:45.22)
▶ Rem : So I have to take responsibility. (0:09:48.73)
▶ Rem : If I don't, I cannot do anything
for Sister or you... (0:09:51.64)
▶ Rem : I haven't changed at all. (0:09:57.27)
▶ Rem : I committed the same sin
as I did back then! (0:10:01.12)
▶ Rem : Because I hesitated to
extend my hand to you... (0:10:05.37)
▶ Rem : The witch's scent? (0:10:10.84)
▶ Rem : You nearly died. (0:10:12.69)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : I'm not sure what you're talking about, (0:10:18.40)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : but to atone for that, you got mad
and decided to do this alone? (0:10:20.36)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : Rem... (0:10:25.66)
▶ Rem : Yes? (0:10:29.40)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : Super slap! (0:10:30.76)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : For starters, are you dumb? (0:10:34.00)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : No, you are dumb! (0:10:36.44)
▶ Ram : Barusu, the cut on your forehead
has reopened and is bleeding. (0:10:38.38)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : Yeah, I know I'm dumb, too! (0:10:41.46)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : But your sister is even dumber! (0:10:43.76)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : Listen, where I'm from there's a saying,
"Three heads are better than one." (0:10:46.56)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : Wait, is it two heads? (0:10:50.89)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : Whatever... The point is, (0:10:52.32)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : three heads, thinking together,
are harder to break than only one arrow! (0:10:53.83)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : It means you should rely on (0:10:57.89)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : those around you instead of
thinking about stuff alone! (0:10:59.42)
▶ Rem : Subaru-kun... (0:11:02.57)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : Damn... (0:11:08.43)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : Ram, which way should we run
to get outside the barrier? (0:11:09.97)
▶ Ram : We'd have to run left, at full
speed. What's your plan? (0:11:13.00)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : I could shove Rem toward you and
run tragically to the right— (0:11:18.06)
▶ Ram : I'll draw the ulgarm's attention, (0:11:22.21)
▶ Ram : while you take Rem and run. (0:11:23.78)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : Could you not expose my attempt at
hiding my embarrassment so easily?! (0:11:25.30)
▶ Rem : There's no way you will survive. (0:11:28.04)
▶ Rem : Please don't. If you do that, I will... (0:11:30.66)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : Don't worry. (0:11:34.72)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : You don't know my brilliant plan
to round up all the mabeasts. (0:11:36.32)
▶ Rem : Subaru-kun, why would you do all this? (0:11:40.84)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : Well... (0:11:44.76)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : You were my partner for my very first date. (0:11:50.23)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : I wouldn't be so heartless as to desert you. (0:11:54.27)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : All right, guess I'd better go and do this. (0:12:00.48)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : Take care of Rem, Onee-sama! (0:12:03.96)
▶ Ram : I'll be praying for our safe reunion, Barusu. (0:12:06.23)
▶ Ram : Barusu's risking his life to buy us time. (0:12:10.42)
▶ Ram : Let's make the most of it. (0:12:13.04)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : I'd love to finish you off right about now... (0:12:22.76)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : I have an ace up my sleeve, too! (0:12:37.53)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : It's you and me, pal... Get ready! (0:12:40.07)
▶ Rem : Sister! Subaru-kun is... Subaru-kun is... (0:12:44.11)
▶ Ram : Don't look back, Rem. (0:12:47.03)
▶ Ram : Barusu's determination will be for nothing. (0:12:48.77)
▶ Rem : Sissy! (0:12:58.51)
▶ Rem : Subaru-kun! (0:13:08.03)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : Shamac! (0:13:13.10)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : I could do without the bugs,
but I appreciate the bocco fruit! (0:13:26.31)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : Thanks for that, brats. (0:13:29.40)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : Crap— (0:13:33.92)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : You need to die! (0:13:40.78)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : What's the matter?
Bring it on, boss garm! (0:13:46.84)
▶ Roswaal L. Mathers : Ulgoa! (0:13:52.06)
▶ Roswaal L. Mathers : Oh, my! You look an absolute fright! (0:14:00.91)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : You're way late, Ros-chi... (0:14:07.84)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : But I'm surprised you
knew where to find me. (0:14:14.79)
▶ Roswaal L. Mathers : In the village, Emilia-sama drove
it into me quite thoroughly... (0:14:17.84)
▶ Roswaal L. Mathers : "Even if it's rash or reckless,
he'll use magic if he's cornered, (0:14:22.79)
▶ Roswaal L. Mathers : so don't lose sight of
him from above," she said. (0:14:26.02)
▶ Ram : Roswaal-sama! (0:14:29.73)
▶ Ram : I am sorry to cause so
much trouble for you! (0:14:36.14)
▶ Roswaal L. Mathers : Oh, not at all. (0:14:39.00)
▶ Roswaal L. Mathers : In fact, you both did fine work in my absence. (0:14:41.25)
▶ Roswaal L. Mathers : I shall most certainly show my
gratitude for your actions. (0:14:47.19)
▶ Roswaal L. Mathers : You have my word. (0:14:51.53)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : Subaru-kun! (0:14:53.93)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : Rem, that hurts! Stop! (0:14:55.70)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : I'm kinda hurt all over right now... (0:14:58.50)
▶ Rem : You're alive... You stayed alive... (0:15:00.92)
▶ Rem : Subaru-kun! Subaru-kun! Subaru-kun! (0:15:03.67)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : This... again... (0:15:07.24)
▶ Rem : Are you awake? (0:15:18.65)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : Did I do this? Like, grabbed you
and never let go? (0:15:28.38)
▶ Rem : No, um... This is, well... (0:15:33.04)
▶ Rem : I did it. (0:15:36.04)
▶ Rem : While you slept, you looked as
if you were in pain, so I... (0:15:38.86)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : You held my hand? (0:15:44.06)
▶ Rem : At times like these,
I do not know what to do, (0:15:46.53)
▶ Rem : so I did what would have made me
happiest, were I in your place. (0:15:50.68)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : Anyway, I'd like to hear the rest... I mean, (0:15:55.28)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : I'd like to know how it ended. (0:15:58.49)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : Were my curses removed? (0:16:00.76)
▶ Rem : Yes. Roswaal-sama took
care of all the mabeasts. (0:16:03.28)
▶ Rem : So there is no chance
the curses will activate. (0:16:08.54)
▶ Rem : I am sorry, Subaru-kun. (0:16:15.76)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : Hey... Come on, lift your head, Rem. (0:16:18.08)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : There's nothing wrong with me. (0:16:20.70)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : You always look calm, (0:16:25.02)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : but you're not remotely calm
or collected, are you? (0:16:27.05)
▶ Rem : I do realize (0:16:31.20)
▶ Rem : that I am a powerless and
incompetent demon clan dropout. (0:16:33.87)
▶ Rem : So no matter what I do,
I can never match my sister. (0:16:38.73)
▶ Rem : I am merely her replacement, (0:16:42.06)
▶ Rem : and I have always been inferior. (0:16:44.24)
▶ Rem : Good for nothing. (0:16:46.45)
▶ Rem : Why was I the one to keep my horn? (0:16:51.08)
▶ Rem : Why could Sister not be the one to keep hers? (0:16:56.41)
▶ Rem : Why was she born with only one horn? (0:17:01.07)
▶ Rem : Why did... we have to be twins? (0:17:06.75)
▶ Rem : I apologize. That was a strange
thing for me to say. (0:17:13.57)
▶ Rem : Please forget it. (0:17:17.38)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : You know, Rem, you keep
putting Ram on a pedestal (0:17:21.07)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : and undermining yourself, (0:17:25.80)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : but if she were in your position, (0:17:27.99)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : I don't think she'd be any better off. (0:17:30.23)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : Ram is weaker than you, she can't cook, (0:17:33.15)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : slacks off on the job, says mean things. (0:17:35.81)
▶ Rem : Y-You're wrong! (0:17:38.03)
▶ Rem : Sister's true self is more... (0:17:40.28)
▶ Rem : If she had her horn, you would not say... (0:17:42.20)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : But Ram doesn't have her horn, (0:17:44.80)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : so I don't know that Ram. (0:17:48.08)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : I'm pretty sure you're the only one (0:17:50.72)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : who cares whether she has a horn or not. (0:17:52.91)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : What Ram doesn't have, you do. (0:17:57.48)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : Just accept that. (0:18:00.69)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : You're kind, hardworking, always do your best, (0:18:03.17)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : and your chest is bigger than hers! (0:18:06.91)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : If you hadn't been around, those dogs
would've chewed me to death. (0:18:10.55)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : I was saved because you were there. (0:18:15.65)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : And as you can see, I'm alive! (0:18:18.90)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : Not only because of your sister,
but because of you. (0:18:21.23)
▶ Rem : My true Sister could have done much more. (0:18:25.86)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : Maybe so. (0:18:28.88)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : But you were the one who was there for me. (0:18:31.28)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : I'm glad you were there... (0:18:35.93)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : Thank you. (0:18:38.64)
▶ Rem : I... I told you that I am only
my sister's replacement. (0:18:41.54)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : Don't define yourself that way. It's too sad. (0:18:46.04)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : Of course, I haven't heard the details
of how she lost her horn. (0:18:49.31)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : I won't ask, so I'll never know. (0:18:52.76)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : And since I don't know, I get to
talk as if I know all about it. (0:18:55.06)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : All you have to do is be the
horn Ram doesn't have. (0:19:01.12)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : You two can be a demon together. (0:19:05.55)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : Also, you call yourself a replacement, (0:19:10.27)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : but no one could replace you. (0:19:13.21)
▶ Rem : But... (0:19:16.83)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : Where I come from, there's a saying, (0:19:17.80)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : "Demons laugh when you talk about next year." (0:19:19.49)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : So... (0:19:23.32)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : Laugh, Rem. (0:19:25.24)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : Take off that sad face, and laugh. (0:19:27.27)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : Laugh while we talk about the future! (0:19:30.64)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : While we talk, look forward to making up for (0:19:33.96)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : all the time you've wasted looking back! (0:19:37.16)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : We can start by talking about tomorrow. (0:19:40.29)
▶ Rem : Tomorrow? (0:19:42.80)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : Yep, tomorrow. (0:19:44.48)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : You can say anything, like... (0:19:46.88)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : Whether you'll make a Japanese- or
Western-style breakfast tomorrow, (0:19:48.63)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : or whether you'll put on your
right or left shoe first. (0:19:54.80)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : It can be something silly like that. (0:19:57.90)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : No matter how silly it is, (0:20:00.41)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : you can talk about tomorrow
because you have a tomorrow. (0:20:02.41)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : How about it? (0:20:05.47)
▶ Rem : I am... very weak. (0:20:07.34)
▶ Rem : So I'm sure I will end up leaning on you. (0:20:11.43)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : What's wrong with that? (0:20:15.23)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : I'm weak, stupid, scary-looking, and dense. (0:20:17.25)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : But I still live my life, expecting others
to take care of things for me... (0:20:22.14)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : As we move forward, we can
lean on each other. (0:20:28.07)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : Let's laugh and talk about tomorrow,
arms around each other's shoulders. (0:20:32.35)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : It's always been my dream to talk
about next year with a demon (0:20:37.14)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : while we both laugh! (0:20:40.40)
▶ Rem : You are fanatical like a demon. (0:20:44.97)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : Right? (0:20:49.13)
▶ Roswaal L. Mathers : By the way, Ram, (0:21:13.32)
▶ Roswaal L. Mathers : did you find the one who was
controlling the mabeasts? (0:21:14.89)
▶ Ram : Yes, but the trail has already vanished. (0:21:19.56)
▶ Ram : It seems one of the children that
Barusu and Rem brought back (0:21:23.59)
▶ Ram : from the forest disappeared the next day. (0:21:27.10)
▶ Roswaal L. Mathers : Is this going to be another
battle for the throne? (0:21:29.35)
▶ Roswaal L. Mathers : The Bowel Hunter, mabeast masters... (0:21:33.02)
▶ Roswaal L. Mathers : We have involved ourselves with
some bizarre characters. (0:21:35.82)
▶ Ram : No matter how many strange
characters you face, (0:21:38.84)
▶ Ram : you aren't the sort to lose heart, are you? (0:21:41.65)
▶ Roswaal L. Mathers : My, how audacious you have become. (0:21:44.36)
▶ Roswaal L. Mathers : Come here. (0:21:48.92)
▶ Roswaal L. Mathers : Now, shall we begin? (0:21:53.72)
▶ Roswaal L. Mathers : I was unable to attend to you
for a whole night, after all. (0:21:57.03)
▶ Ram : I'm sorry. Please do. (0:22:00.14)
▶ Roswaal L. Mathers : You have used quite a lot of mana. (0:22:03.34)
▶ Roswaal L. Mathers : May the stars protect you. (0:22:06.51)
▶ Roswaal L. Mathers : I shall be busy again for a time. (0:22:14.52)
▶ Roswaal L. Mathers : I know it will be hard on you,
but look after yourself and Rem... (0:22:16.76)
▶ Ram : As you wish. (0:22:21.38)
▶ Ram : Since that fiery night, (0:22:23.67)
▶ Ram : my body has belonged to you, Roswaal-sama. (0:22:26.35)
▶ Roswaal L. Mathers : I must win this battle for the throne,
no matter what it takes. (0:22:28.79)
▶ Roswaal L. Mathers : For the sake of my goal. (0:22:33.44)
▶ Roswaal L. Mathers : For the coming day when I kill the dragon... (0:22:37.92)
▶ Emilia : You're constantly getting hurt,
aren't you, Subaru? (0:22:42.62)
▶ Emilia : You came to this mansion in the
first place because you were injured. (0:22:46.47)
▶ Emilia : Since then, it's only been four days. (0:22:50.03)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : It's not like I get hurt because I want to. (0:22:53.20)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : The world's just a little harsh on me... (0:22:56.79)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : So you're welcome to spoil me rotten,
since no one else will, Emilia-tan! (0:23:00.80)
▶ Emilia : Don't joke around. (0:23:04.99)
▶ Emilia : Puck kept trying to get me
to go after you guys, too. (0:23:06.74)
▶ Emilia : Who knows what would've happened
if Roswaal hadn't made it back? (0:23:11.04)
▶ Emilia : Do you get it? (0:23:14.15)
▶ Emilia : Still, I suppose you saved me again. (0:23:17.40)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : Huh? (0:23:20.52)
▶ Emilia : As thanks for saving me, I brought
you to the mansion, (0:23:21.52)
▶ Emilia : and now... (0:23:25.83)
▶ Emilia : Still, thank you so much! (0:23:27.53)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : Hey! It's fine, it's fine! (0:23:31.72)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : I only did it because I wanted to... (0:23:33.72)
▶ Emilia : I thought you'd say that, (0:23:35.95)
▶ Emilia : but it doesn't make me feel any better. (0:23:38.24)
▶ Emilia : I must do something to thank you... (0:23:40.90)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : Okay. Then, I'll take you up on that. (0:23:42.98)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : Go on a date with me, Emilia-tan! (0:23:47.09)
▶ Emilia : A "date"? (0:23:49.48)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : We'll go out together, see the same things, (0:23:51.11)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : eat the same things, do the same things, (0:23:54.23)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : and share the same memories. (0:23:56.31)
▶ Emilia : And that's all you want? (0:23:59.12)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : That's exactly what I want. (0:24:01.12)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : I want to show you off to the village kids, (0:24:03.23)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : and there's this awesome flower field! (0:24:05.87)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : Even if all we do is stroll around,
it'd be a special occasion to me! (0:24:08.02)
▶ Emilia : All right. I'll go on a date with you! (0:24:15.92)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : Yes! That's why you're my EMF! (0:24:23.74)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : Oh, "EMF" stands for "Emilia-tan, major fairy"! (0:24:27.32)▶ Subaru Natsuki : Okay, finally... (0:00:12.25)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : Victory! (0:00:14.08)
▶ EXTRA : Victory! (0:00:15.67)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : All right, line up! (0:00:19.77)
▶ EXTRA : Yay! (0:00:22.58)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : Time for your stamps! (0:00:23.15)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : Okay, who's first? (0:00:24.62)
▶ EXTRA : The kitty's so cute! (0:00:29.53)
▶ EXTRA : The kitty's awesome! (0:00:30.82)
▶ EXTRA : The kitty's so sad! (0:00:32.06)
▶ Emilia : The villagers seem to be full of life again. (0:00:35.02)
▶ Emilia : Thanks to you, Subaru. (0:00:38.17)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : Well, I did put my life
on the line to save them... (0:00:40.56)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : I went into the forest and
got bitten by dogs to save the kids, (0:00:45.22)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : got bitten by dogs when I tried to save
Rem after she turned into a demon, (0:00:48.51)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : then had to be saved by Roswaal when I was about to be bitten by a giant dog... (0:00:51.38)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : Wait. (0:00:56.91)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : Did I even do anything at all? (0:00:58.19)
▶ Emilia : Oh, come on! Don't fuss
over the small details! (0:01:00.62)
▶ Emilia : There are those who know the truth. (0:01:04.11)
▶ Emilia : That includes Roswaal and Ram. (0:01:06.99)
▶ Emilia : And especially Rem. (0:01:09.07)
▶ Emilia : And of course, (0:01:10.98)
▶ Emilia : I do, too. (0:01:12.30)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : A dragon-drawn carriage? (0:01:17.53)
▶ Wilhelm van Astrea : Welcome home. (0:01:18.88)
▶ Wilhelm van Astrea : Please forgive me for parking
in front of your mansion. (0:01:20.99)
▶ Ram : An emissary is visiting from the capital. (0:01:32.57)
▶ Ram : Roswaal-sama is attending to them now. (0:01:35.69)
▶ Ram : Emilia-sama, please join him. (0:01:38.17)
▶ Emilia : An emissary? (0:01:40.29)
▶ Ram : I believe it concerns the royal selection. (0:01:41.99)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : All right... (0:01:46.38)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : Given the circumstances,
I'll try not to do anything dumb. (0:01:47.48)
▶ Emilia : Um, I'm really sorry, Subaru, (0:01:51.26)
▶ Emilia : but this will be a very important discussion. (0:01:54.61)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : Aren't you bored waiting out here? (0:02:09.87)
▶ Wilhelm van Astrea : It tastes lovely. (0:02:18.53)
▶ Wilhelm van Astrea : I feel as though I'm
indulging in a great luxury. (0:02:20.20)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : It's actually the most expensive
tea in the mansion. (0:02:22.90)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : If the pink-haired maid learns we drank
it without permission, she'll flip. (0:02:25.76)
▶ Wilhelm van Astrea : And what is it you hope to gain (0:02:30.49)
▶ Wilhelm van Astrea : from this old man, using such precious bait? (0:02:33.43)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : I only want to know
the reason for this visit. (0:02:36.52)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : If you could just give me a vague idea... (0:02:39.21)
▶ Wilhelm van Astrea : As I have no idea what your
standing is in this mansion, (0:02:41.95)
▶ Wilhelm van Astrea : I cannot say anything careless. (0:02:45.90)
▶ Wilhelm van Astrea : Please understand. (0:02:49.24)
▶ Wilhelm van Astrea : However, I did see that you are
quite close to Emilia-sama. (0:02:51.57)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : Did it look like things were serious
between Emilia-tan and me?! (0:02:56.15)
▶ Wilhelm van Astrea : "Tan"? (0:03:00.16)
▶ Wilhelm van Astrea : It is a steep path you climb. (0:03:02.40)
▶ Wilhelm van Astrea : You are dealing with one who may
be Lugunica's future queen. (0:03:05.13)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : Right now, we're just a super cute
girl and a useless servant boy. (0:03:09.31)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : You probably think your wife is
the prettiest girl in the world. (0:03:14.48)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : Isn't that what you thought
when you proposed to her? (0:03:18.24)
▶ Wilhelm van Astrea : My wife... (0:03:22.09)
▶ Wilhelm van Astrea : I understand. You are correct indeed. (0:03:25.02)
▶ Wilhelm van Astrea : I believed my wife the most
beautiful lady in the world. (0:03:28.72)
▶ Felix Argyle : I'm back, Old Man Wil! (0:03:32.46)
▶ Felix Argyle : Sorry to make you wait outside. (0:03:34.25)
▶ Felix Argyle : I bet you were bored, huh? (0:03:36.26)
▶ Wilhelm van Astrea : Not at all. (0:03:37.79)
▶ Wilhelm van Astrea : This young man has been speaking with me. (0:03:39.31)
▶ Felix Argyle : Ah, nyow I see... Of course. (0:03:49.23)
▶ Felix Argyle : You must be the boy Emilia-sama mentioned. (0:03:51.77)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : Emilia did? (0:03:54.80)
▶ Felix Argyle : I guess you know nyothing at all, huh? (0:03:56.32)
▶ Felix Argyle : Let's go, Old Man Wil. (0:03:59.32)
▶ Felix Argyle : See you in the capital. (0:04:01.66)
▶ Emilia : Well, see, we aren't going for fun. (0:04:05.16)
▶ Emilia : I received an important summons— (0:04:07.82)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : If it's important, all the more reason! (0:04:08.99)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : Aren't you in a battle for the
throne? I want to help you! (0:04:11.08)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : Please! (0:04:15.14)
▶ Rem : It seems there are people in the
capital who helped Subaru-kun. (0:04:18.12)
▶ Rem : This may be a good opportunity
for him to thank them. (0:04:22.77)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : Nice assist, Rem! (0:04:25.45)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : That's right! (0:04:27.66)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : Some people in the capital helped me. (0:04:29.35)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : I need to let them know I'm okay. (0:04:31.60)
▶ Roswaal L. Mathers : Why not? (0:04:34.83)
▶ Roswaal L. Mathers : That can be kept separate from
our royal selection business. (0:04:36.80)
▶ Roswaal L. Mathers : Subaru-kun should go to the
capital to thank everyone, (0:04:40.12)
▶ Roswaal L. Mathers : as well as to receive treatment. (0:04:44.41)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : Huh? Treatment? (0:04:46.83)
▶ Roswaal L. Mathers : You overused your already-exhausted
gate in the mabeast battle... (0:04:49.02)
▶ Roswaal L. Mathers : Treatment would tend that wound. (0:04:53.41)
▶ Roswaal L. Mathers : You met the emissary earlier, did you not? (0:04:55.29)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : The cutesy-face with the cat ears? (0:04:58.41)
▶ Roswaal L. Mathers : That was one of the capital's most
brilliant users of water magic, (0:05:00.70)
▶ Roswaal L. Mathers : as well as healing magic! (0:05:04.28)
▶ Roswaal L. Mathers : Felix is a peculiar character. (0:05:07.05)
▶ Roswaal L. Mathers : Even Emilia-sama had difficulty
enlisting Felix's cooperation... (0:05:09.40)
▶ Emilia : Hey. (0:05:13.10)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : Really, Emilia-tan? (0:05:13.80)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : You did that for me? (0:05:15.32)
▶ Emilia : W-Well, it's partly my fault that
you haven't healed yet... (0:05:16.32)
▶ Emilia : So you could say I'm repaying a debt. (0:05:20.91)
▶ Emilia : It's compensation equal to what you gave up! (0:05:23.06)
▶ Felix Argyle : I was surprised to see you
talk with that boy. (0:05:28.53)
▶ Felix Argyle : I thought you preferred chopping people
in half than talking to them. (0:05:32.39)
▶ Wilhelm van Astrea : That is a grave misunderstanding. (0:05:35.76)
▶ Wilhelm van Astrea : I merely took a bit of a liking
to that young man's eyes. (0:05:38.04)
▶ Wilhelm van Astrea : Those are the eyes of one who has
experienced death several times. (0:05:43.31)
▶ Felix Argyle : Hmm, you've lost me nyow . (0:05:48.74)
▶ Felix Argyle : But if Wilhelm van Astrea,
the sword demon, says it, (0:05:51.77)
▶ Felix Argyle : I'm sure the boy faces quite a bumpy road. (0:05:56.60)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : You know, Emilia-tan... (0:06:04.30)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : Maybe we should stop this? (0:06:06.97)
▶ Emilia : Absolutely not! (0:06:08.78)
▶ Emilia : I know you. (0:06:10.61)
▶ Emilia : The moment I look away, you'll be
doing something crazy. (0:06:11.95)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : Oh, man! I'm seriously moved! (0:06:16.43)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : I'm totally fantasying right now, baby! (0:06:20.20)
▶ Rem : Subaru-kun is cute. (0:06:23.23)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : Parallel worlds rul— (0:06:25.05)
▶ Emilia : Subaru! (0:06:28.62)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : I'm really sorry for that. (0:06:30.11)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : But this is treating me like a kid! (0:06:32.71)
▶ Emilia : Even though you wanted to hold
hands on our date in the village? (0:06:35.15)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : I was physically and
mentally prepared for that. (0:06:38.29)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : This time, I'm not! (0:06:41.43)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : My hand's sweating like crazy! (0:06:42.83)
▶ Kadomon Risch : Would you two quit
it with the flirting already? (0:06:44.24)
▶ Kadomon Risch : You're gonna drive away my customers. (0:06:47.66)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : After I came to make good on my promise? (0:06:50.30)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : That's cold, man... (0:06:52.66)
▶ Kadomon Risch : Well, I appreciate that
you felt obliged to shop, (0:06:54.24)
▶ Kadomon Risch : now that you're not broke anymore. (0:06:56.55)
▶ Kadomon Risch : Here are the appas I promised. (0:06:59.74)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : Next, it's Felt and Old Man Rom. (0:07:03.77)
▶ Emilia : I thought we'd wrapped things up
without blame the first time. (0:07:06.09)
▶ Emilia : But then Reinhard's expression went dark, (0:07:10.28)
▶ Emilia : and he took the girl away. (0:07:12.87)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : That makes it sound like kidnapping,
or an abduction and confinement. (0:07:15.04)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : Hot guys really have it good... (0:07:19.18)
▶ Emilia : If we want to contact Reinhard, (0:07:21.22)
▶ Emilia : we should probably go to the guard station
in front of the district for the nobility. (0:07:23.86)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : Emilia-tan, about the royal selection
that begins tomorrow... (0:07:28.19)
▶ Emilia : Subaru, (0:07:31.98)
▶ Emilia : what did I tell you? (0:07:33.01)
▶ Emilia : I brought you here to fulfill your
promises and to get you healed. (0:07:34.05)
▶ Emilia : You don't have to worry about me. (0:07:40.80)
▶ Julius Euclius : Well, if it isn't Emilia-sama. (0:07:50.62)
▶ Julius Euclius : It's good to see you again. (0:07:54.18)
▶ Julius Euclius : Have you been well since we last met? (0:07:55.61)
▶ Emilia : Yes, everything is basically the same. (0:07:58.20)
▶ Emilia : You also seem well, Julius. (0:08:01.10)
▶ Julius Euclius : The mere fact that you
remember me is an honor. (0:08:02.91)
▶ Julius Euclius : You have only grown more
beautiful, Emilia-sama. (0:08:05.76)
▶ Emilia : Thank you. Forgive me for asking so abruptly. (0:08:13.52)
▶ Emilia : But I have business here, and I'd like you
to act as my agent in the castle. (0:08:16.56)
▶ Julius Euclius : Does your business involve this young man? (0:08:20.26)
▶ Julius Euclius : His character and attitude
poorly suit his attire. (0:08:25.99)
▶ Julius Euclius : That's no way to act before
one you've just met. (0:08:29.24)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : Thanks for the warning! (0:08:31.74)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : I've got a warning for you, too. (0:08:33.82)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : You shouldn't eat curry udon in that suit. (0:08:37.61)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : If the soup splatters, the stains
will really stand out. (0:08:40.12)
▶ Julius Euclius : I don't know what "curry udon" is, (0:08:43.46)
▶ Julius Euclius : but I shall keep that in mind. (0:08:46.40)
▶ Julius Euclius : Now, allow me to show you
to the conference mirrors. (0:08:48.25)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : Conference mirrors? (0:08:52.55)
▶ Emilia : A metia that facilitates talking with someone,
using two mirrors facing one another. (0:08:53.83)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : Ah, mirrors... How very magical. (0:08:58.75)
▶ Emilia : Subaru, wait here. (0:09:01.34)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : Eh? (0:09:02.71)
▶ Emilia : I don't think it would be a pleasant
experience for you. (0:09:05.07)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : I've already had an experience
that wasn't pleasant. (0:09:08.40)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : That bastard, licking all over your cute,
little hand, as if he owned it... (0:09:11.87)
▶ Emilia : I'll try to come back before things run too long. (0:09:16.24)
▶ Emilia : Be good and wait, okay? (0:09:18.97)
▶ Emilia : Please? (0:09:21.29)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : I look so pathetic. (0:09:27.10)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : Doing that in front of the
guard station is bold. (0:09:31.38)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : "It's darkest at the
lighthouse's foot," I guess. (0:09:34.40)
▶ Ton : You little... (0:09:36.91)
▶ Chin : Don't screw around with us! (0:09:38.30)
▶ Kan : Want us to mess up that pretty face of yours? (0:09:39.75)
▶ Priscilla Barielle : Don't make such a racket, commoners. (0:09:43.11)
▶ Priscilla Barielle : Fools with no character pick fights
for the most foolish of reasons... (0:09:45.88)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : Sorry I'm late, honey! (0:09:49.52)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : It appears there's been a bit of trouble. (0:09:51.82)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : But remember who I am,
and cut me some slack. (0:09:54.03)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : Now, let's go. (0:09:56.95)
▶ Priscilla Barielle : Do not touch me as if you know me! (0:09:59.01)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : Cliffhanger... (0:10:02.24)
▶ Priscilla Barielle : I don't want drooling commoners
to follow me around. (0:10:04.36)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : Recognize what's going on! (0:10:07.96)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : It was supposed to be a classic scenario
where I save a girl from hoodlums! (0:10:10.33)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : Wait, no way. (0:10:16.74)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : Are you three the capital's only hoodlums? (0:10:17.82)
▶ Ton : We met this guy in the alley
behind the shopping district. (0:10:20.26)
▶ Chin : It's the brat from back then? (0:10:22.54)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : So, for my sake, could you just let us— (0:10:24.17)
▶ Kan : Are you dumb? (0:10:26.69)
▶ Kan : This just makes it three on two,
instead of three on one... (0:10:28.10)
▶ Priscilla Barielle : You should correct that. (0:10:31.67)
▶ Priscilla Barielle : It isn't three on two,
but three on one on one. (0:10:32.98)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : Would you be quiet for a second?! (0:10:35.98)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : I have no choice. (0:10:37.96)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : This is the last trick
I wanted to use, but... (0:10:39.39)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : I'm just telling you, I know Reinhard-san. (0:10:43.46)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : If I call for him, he'll come running! (0:10:47.53)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : Secret Technique: Fox in Tiger's Clothing. (0:10:52.85)
▶ Rom : Been a while since I've seen you. (0:11:01.62)
▶ Rom : What're ya doing here? (0:11:04.03)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : Old Man Rom! (0:11:07.01)
▶ Chin : Damn you! (0:11:09.55)
▶ Kan : Damn you! (0:11:09.55)
▶ Ton : Damn you! (0:11:09.55)
▶ Kan : We won't forget this! (0:11:11.17)
▶ Ton : We won't forget this! (0:11:11.17)
▶ Chin : We won't forget this! (0:11:11.17)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : You saved me, Old Man Rom... (0:11:14.40)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : I doubt this girl and I
could've handled that alone. (0:11:16.49)
▶ Priscilla Barielle : Don't misunderstand. (0:11:19.98)
▶ Priscilla Barielle : Even without you two, I was in no trouble. (0:11:21.63)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : Say what? (0:11:25.72)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : "I didn't need your help. I'm super
strong! I was doing just fine!" (0:11:27.08)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : Something like that? (0:11:32.80)
▶ Priscilla Barielle : No. (0:11:33.75)
▶ Priscilla Barielle : This world is designed to operate in
the way that works best for me, (0:11:34.74)
▶ Priscilla Barielle : so I am never at a disadvantage. (0:11:38.03)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : R-Really? (0:11:40.65)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : Well, I shouldn't have butted in, then. (0:11:42.72)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : Sorry to interfere! (0:11:44.96)
▶ Rom : By the way, boy, (0:11:46.66)
▶ Rom : you know where Felt went off to? (0:11:48.32)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : You didn't hear? (0:11:50.75)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : Apparently, Reinhard took her away. (0:11:52.03)
▶ Rom : Reinhard... (0:11:55.01)
▶ Rom : It had to be an Astrea, eh? (0:11:57.45)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : Something wrong? (0:12:02.22)
▶ Rom : Nah, just talkin' to myself. (0:12:03.62)
▶ Rom : You try not to cause
any more trouble, ya hear? (0:12:06.01)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : S-Sure. (0:12:09.49)
▶ Emilia : I finally found you! (0:12:13.88)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : Oh, Emili— (0:12:15.95)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : Wait, wait, wait! (0:12:17.76)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : You can't just pick up Emilia-tan
while I'm away! (0:12:19.51)
▶ Aldebaran : Seems your buddy's got a
screw loose, little lady. (0:12:22.84)
▶ Aldebaran : More worried about losing you to
another man than happy to see you. (0:12:25.85)
▶ Aldebaran : A man's heart is so complex,
it's a thrill to watch. (0:12:29.10)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : You've got a pretty messed-up
fashion sense of your own! (0:12:32.46)
▶ Aldebaran : Now, that's no way to talk to someone... (0:12:35.85)
▶ Aldebaran : As I'm a cool,
good-natured man, I'll overlook it. (0:12:38.34)
▶ Aldebaran : But some might lop off your head for that. (0:12:41.16)
▶ Emilia : Relax, Subaru. His outfit surprised me, too. (0:12:43.70)
▶ Aldebaran : Yeah, well... (0:12:48.78)
▶ Aldebaran : I was surprised when she asked for my help
while I was looking for a lost child, too. (0:12:50.24)
▶ Emilia : Emilia-tan, you're too soft-hearted. (0:12:55.58)
▶ Emilia : Most would think a guy dressed like this
was looking for a lost child to kidnap them. (0:12:57.79)
▶ Priscilla Barielle : My, how attentive you are to wait
where you knew I would be. (0:13:02.56)
▶ Priscilla Barielle : I commend your dedication, Al. (0:13:06.86)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : You were the lost child? (0:13:09.29)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : Well, it looks like we both found the
ones we were looking for. Let's go. (0:13:15.48)
▶ Priscilla Barielle : Wait. (0:13:19.25)
▶ Priscilla Barielle : What is in that bag? (0:13:20.59)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : They're appas. (0:13:23.24)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : You've never seen one? (0:13:24.73)
▶ Priscilla Barielle : Don't make me laugh. (0:13:25.92)
▶ Priscilla Barielle : Appas have white flesh. (0:13:27.45)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : Well, yeah, the insides are white... (0:13:29.56)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : Wait, s-so you've never
seen an unpeeled appa? (0:13:31.88)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : For you. (0:13:41.96)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : Don't skip off after
any bad guys again, okay? (0:13:43.34)
▶ Emilia : Subaru... (0:13:47.92)
▶ Emilia : That girl from before... (0:13:49.54)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : Huh? (0:13:51.53)
▶ Emilia : Where did you meet that girl? (0:13:52.83)
▶ Emilia : And how? (0:13:55.59)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : What's this, Emilia-tan? Are you jealous? (0:13:57.20)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : Are you actually getting jealous over me? (0:13:59.70)
▶ Emilia : Subaru... (0:14:03.34)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : H-Huh? Emilia-tan, why the serious face? (0:14:06.54)
▶ Emilia : N-Nothing... If you don't know, it's fine. (0:14:11.18)
▶ Emilia : Forget it. (0:14:14.51)
▶ Priscilla Barielle : Oh! It really is an appa! (0:14:24.94)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : Huh? I have to stay here tomorrow? (0:14:28.98)
▶ Emilia : Of course you do. (0:14:31.26)
▶ Emilia : That was our agreement all along. (0:14:33.10)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : Yeah, but we never reached Reinhard, right? (0:14:35.09)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : So if we go to the castle tomorrow,
we might see him... (0:14:38.84)
▶ Emilia : I'll be sure to ask about Felt. (0:14:41.32)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : But I should go in person to— (0:14:44.17)
▶ Emilia : This is exactly why I can't take you with me. (0:14:46.25)
▶ Emilia : If I do, you'll push yourself too hard again. (0:14:48.61)
▶ Emilia : I don't want to let you do that. Understand? (0:14:52.33)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : You're the one who doesn't understand... (0:14:54.78)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : If I have to push myself to help you, I will. (0:14:57.23)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : I want to push myself! (0:15:00.62)
▶ Emilia : Absolutely not. (0:15:04.81)
▶ Emilia : Until your body fully heals, (0:15:06.56)
▶ Emilia : no using magic or pushing yourself! (0:15:08.14)
▶ Emilia : Promise me, Subaru. (0:15:10.65)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : All right. I promise. (0:15:14.01)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : I won't use magic... (0:15:16.60)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : So let me go with you! (0:15:18.95)
▶ Emilia : I can't bring an outsider into this. (0:15:21.36)
▶ Emilia : So please wait here with Rem, all right? (0:15:23.52)
▶ Emilia : I'm asking you, Subaru... (0:15:35.49)
▶ Emilia : Give me reason to trust you. (0:15:37.57)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : I know there are those in the capital
who consider Emilia an enemy. (0:15:44.49)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : That's why I have to stay close to her. (0:15:49.94)
▶ Rem : What's the matter? (0:15:53.93)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : I'm going to save Emilia. (0:15:56.52)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : And to do that... (0:15:58.72)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : Stare... (0:16:02.11)
▶ Rem : Wh-What is it, Subaru-kun? (0:16:04.05)
▶ Rem : When you stare with such dramatic
eyes, it makes me uncomfortable. (0:16:06.22)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : Stare... (0:16:09.48)
▶ Rem : It's at the castle. (0:16:18.30)
▶ Rem : There will likely be heavy security, though. (0:16:19.97)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : Security isn't the problem. (0:16:22.25)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : I can't stand not being involved
in Emilia's important affairs. (0:16:24.76)
▶ Rem : Subaru-kun... (0:16:27.81)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : I'm only of any use when something happens. (0:16:29.24)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : So I want to be with her when
important things are going on! (0:16:32.93)
▶ Rem : Now, I shall set about preparing a new
appa recipe I just thought up. (0:16:39.47)
▶ Rem : It will require intense concentration, (0:16:45.22)
▶ Rem : so if one were to leave his room, (0:16:47.69)
▶ Rem : I likely would not notice. (0:16:50.10)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : I'm such a scumbag for relying
on Rem all the time... (0:16:54.58)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : But the problem is how I'm
gonna get into the castle. (0:17:02.23)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : I guess times like this call for that... (0:17:06.99)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : Hitchhiking! (0:17:09.45)
▶ Aldebaran : You sure are lucky... Be grateful
for this coincidence. (0:17:14.92)
▶ Aldebaran : We just happened to be on our
way to the castle, too. (0:17:17.98)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : The castle? What for? (0:17:20.97)
▶ Priscilla Barielle : There is only one reason to
head to the castle today. (0:17:23.60)
▶ Aldebaran : Oh, you didn't know? (0:17:28.25)
▶ Aldebaran : This young lady here (0:17:30.43)
▶ Aldebaran : is one of the candidates to succeed
to the throne of Lugunica, (0:17:32.71)
▶ Aldebaran : Priscilla Barielle-sama herself. (0:17:36.12)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : For real? Then why did you pick me up? (0:17:38.41)
▶ Priscilla Barielle : For no other reason than it seemed amusing. (0:17:41.78)
▶ Priscilla Barielle : A mere lark. (0:17:44.92)
▶ Priscilla Barielle : Taking you to the castle will
make things interesting. (0:17:46.88)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : Interesting? (0:17:51.18)
▶ Priscilla Barielle : This world is designed to operate in
the way that works best for me, (0:17:52.92)
▶ Priscilla Barielle : so it's a given that all
things work in my favor. (0:17:56.92)
▶ Priscilla Barielle : It is only a matter of choosing whether
something amuses me or not. (0:18:02.59)
▶ Priscilla Barielle : However, if I had to name a reason
other than amusement... (0:18:08.26)
▶ Marcos : Your appa handler? (0:18:15.53)
▶ Priscilla Barielle : Indeed. He is something of a wretched clown, (0:18:18.22)
▶ Priscilla Barielle : whose sole priority is to bring
me bittersweet red appas. (0:18:22.60)
▶ Marcos : Everyone is waiting inside. (0:18:30.57)
▶ Marcos : Make haste, please. (0:18:32.76)
▶ Priscilla Barielle : As their superior, it is my privilege
to keep the masses waiting. (0:18:34.01)
▶ Emilia : Subaru? (0:18:55.05)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : Um... Emilia, I... (0:18:57.13)
▶ Priscilla Barielle : Is there a reason you stare at
my manservant, half-wit? (0:19:01.55)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : Get off! You'll give
Emilia-tan the wrong idea! (0:19:05.87)
▶ Roswaal L. Mathers : My, how nice to see you, Priscilla-sama! (0:19:08.57)
▶ Roswaal L. Mathers : Do forgive my servant for troubling you so. (0:19:11.36)
▶ Emilia : Why are you here, Subaru? (0:19:19.80)
▶ Emilia : Didn't I tell you to be good and wait for me? (0:19:22.56)
▶ Emilia : Don't you remember? (0:19:26.75)
▶ Marcos : The council of wise men will now enter. (0:19:29.45)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : The wise men... (0:19:38.94)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : They're the people managing the country
in the king's absence, right? (0:19:40.65)
▶ Aldebaran : Hey. That's where we're supposed to stand. (0:19:45.16)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : I can stand there, too? (0:19:48.03)
▶ Roswaal L. Mathers : Well, now... (0:19:49.33)
▶ Roswaal L. Mathers : It sounds entertaining, so you
may accompany him. (0:19:51.66)
▶ Emilia : Wait, Roswaal! (0:19:54.51)
▶ Emilia : If Subaru is allowed to stay, he'll— (0:19:56.06)
▶ Roswaal L. Mathers : Emilia-sama, the conference is beginning. (0:19:58.30)
▶ Roswaal L. Mathers : To the center. (0:20:01.26)
▶ Emilia : You'll explain this to me later! (0:20:09.96)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : Then, those are the participants
in the royal selection. (0:20:14.91)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : The candidates for the future ruler? (0:20:18.73)
▶ Reinhard van Astrea : You came, after all, Subaru. (0:20:21.63)
▶ Reinhard van Astrea : When I heard Emilia-sama would be here, (0:20:24.56)
▶ Reinhard van Astrea : I suspected you'd be here, as well. (0:20:27.10)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : Reinhard, I've been looking for you! (0:20:29.45)
▶ Felix Argyle : Hiya, Subaru-kyun ! (0:20:31.74)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : You... (0:20:33.04)
▶ Reinhard van Astrea : Oh, Subaru, you know him? (0:20:34.74)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : Huh? "Him"? (0:20:37.27)
▶ Reinhard van Astrea : Yes. He is a knight, Felix Argyle. (0:20:38.60)
▶ Reinhard van Astrea : Despite appearances, he is male. (0:20:42.33)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : If you're a guy, what's the point in having
those looks and even cat ears? (0:20:44.21)
▶ Felix Argyle : I don't know what to say. (0:20:48.73)
▶ Felix Argyle : You're the one who made the wrong
assumption, Subaru-kyun ! (0:20:50.44)
▶ Reinhard van Astrea : Subaru, what's the matter? (0:21:00.86)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : Where I'm from, this is the expression you
make when seeing a romantic rival! (0:21:02.78)
▶ Marcos : Now, if I may be so forward, (0:21:08.27)
▶ Marcos : I, Marcos, leader of the Imperial Knights, (0:21:10.12)
▶ Marcos : will direct today's proceedings. (0:21:13.00)
▶ Marcos : It all happened about half a year ago, (0:21:16.59)
▶ Marcos : when members of the royal family,
starting with the king, (0:21:18.96)
▶ Marcos : went into hiding, one by one, causing— (0:21:21.94)
▶ Anastasia Hoshin : Listen... (0:21:23.87)
▶ Anastasia Hoshin : I get that you wanna talk up a good
show here, but I'm busy, you know. (0:21:24.68)
▶ Anastasia Hoshin : As we say in Kararagi, "Time is money." (0:21:30.76)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : Wait, the Kansai dialect? Are you kidding me? (0:21:34.86)
Anastasia Hoshin : If you're just repeating
what we already know, (0:21:34.86b)
▶ Anastasia Hoshin : then why did y'all even gather us? (0:21:37.34)
Aldebaran : Evidently, everyone in western
Kararagi speaks that way. (0:21:37.34b)
▶ Crusch Karsten : I agree. (0:21:41.43)
▶ Marcos : Crusch-sama, should the Karsten family
head say something like that? (0:21:42.66)
▶ Crusch Karsten : Observing formality is important,
but it is also a fact (0:21:46.08)
▶ Crusch Karsten : that our time is limited. (0:21:49.18)
▶ Crusch Karsten : It would be wise to inform us
why we are here at once. (0:21:51.93)
▶ Crusch Karsten : Naturally, I do have a general idea. (0:21:55.96)
▶ Miklotov : You already know the purpose of this meeting? (0:21:59.00)
▶ Crusch Karsten : Yes, Lord Miklotov. (0:22:02.56)
▶ Crusch Karsten : For a drinking party, correct? (0:22:04.98)
▶ Crusch Karsten : One day, we will face each other as rivals. (0:22:06.51)
▶ Crusch Karsten : But by sharing the same table and drinks, (0:22:08.88)
▶ Crusch Karsten : we will learn about one another. (0:22:11.83)
▶ Miklotov : No, that is not correct. (0:22:15.40)
▶ Crusch Karsten : Felis, this isn't what you told me. (0:22:19.07)
▶ Felix Argyle : Oh, come on... (0:22:21.87)
▶ Felix Argyle : All I said was,
"Maybe it'll be a drinking party." (0:22:23.45)
▶ Crusch Karsten : I see. I jumped to conclusions. (0:22:28.23)
▶ Crusch Karsten : Forgive me. Allow me to
retract what I just said. (0:22:30.94)
▶ Anastasia Hoshin : Hey, now! (0:22:34.14)
▶ Anastasia Hoshin : Even if she backs down,
my opinion isn't gonna change. (0:22:35.53)
▶ Anastasia Hoshin : No need to explain the royal selection now. (0:22:38.74)
▶ Anastasia Hoshin : We already know. (0:22:41.55)
▶ Anastasia Hoshin : Right? (0:22:43.19)
▶ Emilia : I think we should hear the— (0:22:44.63)
▶ Anastasia Hoshin : Sorry, but I wasn't askin' your opinion. (0:22:46.64)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : Why, you— (0:22:50.06)
▶ Aldebaran : Hey! (0:22:51.41)
▶ Aldebaran : I don't know what's up with the selection,
so I'd kinda like to hear the rest. (0:22:53.07)
▶ Miklotov : Priscilla-sama, I'm told
this man is your knight. (0:22:57.15)
▶ Miklotov : Have you explained the selection to him? (0:23:02.41)
▶ Priscilla Barielle : Either way, you men will
ramble on about it, yes? (0:23:04.35)
▶ Priscilla Barielle : Continue, Marcos. (0:23:09.07)
▶ Marcos : Then... (0:23:11.42)
▶ Marcos : We've gathered you, who are qualified
to be the dragon's priestess, (0:23:13.34)
▶ Marcos : because a new prophecy has been
engraved in the Dragon Stone. (0:23:17.64)
▶ Marcos : It says, "From the five capable of
becoming the nation's new leader, (0:23:21.82)
▶ Marcos : choose one priestess to enter into
a covenant with the dragon." (0:23:25.74)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : Five? (0:23:30.74)
▶ Reinhard van Astrea : Yes, five. (0:23:31.55)
▶ Reinhard van Astrea : Currently, there are only four candidates. (0:23:33.68)
▶ Reinhard van Astrea : The royal selection hadn't even begun. (0:23:36.92)
▶ Reinhard van Astrea : But today, (0:23:41.17)
▶ Reinhard van Astrea : history is set in motion. (0:23:42.81)
▶ Marcos : Knight Reinhard van Astrea, come forward. (0:23:45.36)
▶ Reinhard van Astrea : Yes, sir. (0:23:48.57)
▶ Reinhard van Astrea : Honored members of the council of wise men, (0:23:54.28)
▶ Reinhard van Astrea : I, Reinhard van Astrea,
of the Imperial Knights, (0:23:56.95)
▶ Reinhard van Astrea : would like to announce
my mission's completion. (0:24:00.68)
▶ Reinhard van Astrea : The dragon's priestess, the fifth and
final candidate for the throne, (0:24:04.01)
▶ Reinhard van Astrea : has been located. (0:24:09.66)
▶ Reinhard van Astrea : The one I, myself, revere as queen. (0:24:23.02)
▶ Reinhard van Astrea : Her name... (0:24:27.11)
▶ Reinhard van Astrea : is Felt-sama. (0:24:29.18)▶ Reinhard van Astrea : Felt-sama, thank you for gracing us
with your presence. (0:00:20.54)
▶ Felt : Reinhard... (0:00:25.60)
▶ Felt : You bastard! (0:00:33.84)
▶ Felt : You dragged me here with no explanation,
and what do you call all this?! (0:00:34.98)
▶ Reinhard van Astrea : You surprised me... (0:00:38.77)
▶ Reinhard van Astrea : What's brought on such behavior? (0:00:40.75)
▶ Felt : Don't block my kick and ask me
that, like nothing happened! (0:00:42.96)
▶ Felt : I've had just about all I can take! (0:00:46.01)
▶ Reinhard van Astrea : Does the dress not suit your taste? (0:00:48.60)
▶ Reinhard van Astrea : It looks lovely on you. (0:00:51.05)
▶ Felt : I'm not talking about the dress,
and I'm not embarrassed! (0:00:52.76)
▶ Emilia : That's the girl from... (0:00:55.79)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : I guess it isn't that easy to change
someone at their core... (0:00:58.17)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : And not only me. (0:01:01.79)
▶ Felt : What the heck are you doing here? (0:01:04.23)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : Hey! It's been a while.
How have you be— (0:01:06.54)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : Randaba! (0:01:09.17)
▶ Felt : Looks like the hole in your gut
isn't bothering you anymore. (0:01:11.18)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : If you were worried about that,
be nice to me! (0:01:13.88)
▶ Marcos : Felt-sama, if you have finished
rekindling old friendships, (0:01:16.25)
▶ Marcos : please step over here. (0:01:19.83)
▶ Felt : So, what is it you want me to do? (0:01:23.18)
▶ Reinhard van Astrea : I would like to say,
"To act more like a lady," (0:01:26.08)
▶ Reinhard van Astrea : but this comes first. (0:01:29.53)
▶ Reinhard van Astrea : As you can see, (0:01:42.01)
▶ Reinhard van Astrea : the dragon gem has recognized
Felt-sama as a priestess. (0:01:43.28)
▶ Reinhard van Astrea : With her participation approved, (0:01:47.37)
▶ Reinhard van Astrea : I believe it is time to begin the
royal selection in earnest. (0:01:49.63)
▶ Rickert : Even if the Dragon Stone has recognized her, (0:01:58.54)
▶ Rickert : isn't her selection a bit problematic? (0:02:01.02)
▶ Marcos : You believe we, the Imperial Knights,
have made an error? (0:02:04.01)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : The atmosphere's getting kind of dicey. (0:02:09.61)
▶ Aldebaran : Yeah, but it doesn't bother me. (0:02:12.37)
▶ Felix Argyle : It's nyo big deal to me, either... (0:02:15.10)
▶ Felix Argyle : After all, I've already pledged my
loyalty exclusively to one lady! (0:02:18.03)
▶ Julius Euclius : I feel the same. (0:02:23.39)
▶ Julius Euclius : My sword already belongs to Anastasia-sama. (0:02:25.77)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : Well, my feelings for Emilia won't
come in second to anyone! (0:02:31.13)
▶ EXTRA : She doesn't have the self-awareness
to become a ruler. (0:02:35.74)
▶ EXTRA : You can dress her up, but you
can't give her grace. (0:02:36.70)
▶ EXTRA : She's uneducated, as well. (0:02:39.54)
▶ Miklotov : Silence! (0:02:41.41)
▶ Miklotov : Knight Reinhard, (0:02:44.49)
▶ Miklotov : would you begin by explaining to us
what led you to her discovery? (0:02:46.54)
▶ Reinhard van Astrea : I took custody of Felt-sama in the slums,
about one month ago. (0:02:53.93)
▶ Rickert : She's a gutter rat from the slums?! (0:02:59.10)
▶ Felt : Well, sorry for being a gutter rat! (0:03:03.39)
▶ Felt : You were the ones who dragged
me here against my will! (0:03:05.16)
▶ Priscilla Barielle : All of this long-winded blather
could not be more tedious. (0:03:07.52)
▶ Priscilla Barielle : Of course, I suppose you lived as a gutter rat (0:03:11.95)
▶ Priscilla Barielle : because you could only manage
tedious conversation... (0:03:14.56)
▶ Felt : Oh? If you want a fight, you've got one. (0:03:17.87)
▶ Priscilla Barielle : What insolence. (0:03:20.70)
▶ Priscilla Barielle : Who do you think I am? (0:03:21.92)
▶ Aldebaran : Princess, that isn't... (0:03:24.61)
▶ Reinhard van Astrea : Many pardons, Priscilla-sama. (0:03:28.79)
▶ Emilia : What are you thinking,
in a hallowed place like this? (0:03:30.94)
▶ Priscilla Barielle : I was only trying to teach an
untrained little bitch her place. (0:03:34.19)
▶ Emilia : You won't even apologize? (0:03:38.94)
▶ Priscilla Barielle : Then, will you also apologize for being born? (0:03:41.04)
▶ Priscilla Barielle : You silver-haired half-elf. (0:03:46.97)
▶ Emilia : I have no connection to the witch... (0:03:49.96)
▶ Aldebaran : Princess, could you drop it now? (0:03:53.08)
▶ Aldebaran : I'll be the one to suffer if you
make too many enemies, seriously. (0:03:55.61)
▶ Miklotov : Are you all quite finished? (0:03:59.57)
▶ Marcos : Then, royal selection candidates,
please come forth. (0:04:02.60)
▶ Marcos : Priscilla Barielle-sama and her attendant, Al. (0:04:06.97)
▶ Priscilla Barielle : This selection is pointless. (0:04:10.36)
▶ Priscilla Barielle : I am the one suited to rule this nation! (0:04:12.38)
▶ Priscilla Barielle : All you need to do is serve
me and grovel at my feet. (0:04:15.61)
▶ Marcos : Head of the Karsten family,
Crusch Karsten-sama, (0:04:20.20)
▶ Marcos : and her attendant, the knight Felix Argyle. (0:04:23.32)
▶ Crusch Karsten : Should I become the new ruler, (0:04:27.34)
▶ Crusch Karsten : I will make the dragon forget
the covenant it demanded. (0:04:29.89)
▶ Crusch Karsten : The Dragon's Empire of Lugunica
belongs not to the dragon, (0:04:33.05)
▶ Crusch Karsten : but to us. (0:04:35.85)
▶ Marcos : Anastasia Hoshin-sama,
of the Hoshin Company, (0:04:37.90)
▶ Marcos : and her attendant, the knight Julius Euclius. (0:04:40.76)
▶ Anastasia Hoshin : I'm a greedy gal, so I want everything. (0:04:45.16)
▶ Anastasia Hoshin : No amount of commercial
success can satisfy me. (0:04:48.16)
▶ Anastasia Hoshin : I want my own nation! (0:04:51.09)
▶ Marcos : Emilia-sama and the man endorsing her, (0:04:54.40)
▶ Marcos : Margrave Roswaal L. Mathers. (0:04:57.33)
▶ Emilia : I have only one wish. (0:05:00.14)
▶ Emilia : For all to be equal. (0:05:02.19)
▶ Emilia : I desire to create a nation where
all citizens are equal! (0:05:04.46)
▶ Roswaal L. Mathers : Still, after the introduction of
all those knightly attendants, (0:05:09.27)
▶ Roswaal L. Mathers : I feel terribly out of place here! (0:05:13.88)
▶ Marcos : Finally, Felt-sama and her attendant, (0:05:18.01)
▶ Marcos : the knight Reinhard van Astrea. (0:05:20.54)
▶ Felt : Hang on! Don't get the wrong idea! (0:05:22.68)
▶ Felt : I never said I'd be the next ruler... (0:05:25.16)
▶ Felt : Who'd want to be in a royal selection?! (0:05:28.44)
▶ Marcos : Are you saying you withdraw
from the selection? (0:05:30.91)
▶ Felt : Damn right I am! (0:05:34.21)
▶ Rickert : This is a joke! (0:05:35.37)
▶ Rickert : I've overlooked this because
the situation is dire, (0:05:36.87)
▶ Rickert : but to drag it out this long is senseless! (0:05:39.55)
▶ Bordeaux : He's right. (0:05:42.09)
▶ Bordeaux : The Astrea family offers
a gutter rat to rule us, (0:05:43.30)
▶ Bordeaux : while Margrave Mathers endorses
a half-devil? Utter foolishness! (0:05:46.28)
▶ Roswaal L. Mathers : It isn't at all nice to call
a half-elf a "half-devil." (0:05:49.80)
▶ Bordeaux : That silver-haired half-devil (0:05:54.40)
▶ Bordeaux : matches the Jealous Witch's appearance,
as described for generations! (0:05:56.46)
▶ Bordeaux : Why do you not realize that even allowing
her in the throne room is dreadful? (0:06:00.71)
▶ Bordeaux : Filthy woman! (0:06:04.89)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : Enough of your crap! (0:06:07.69)
▶ Emilia : Subaru, it's all right! Stop this! (0:06:16.19)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : I will not stop! (0:06:18.46)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : You people are full of crap! (0:06:20.33)
▶ Emilia : Apologize to Emilia— (0:06:22.19)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : Subaru! (0:06:23.59)
▶ Emilia : Allow me to formally introduce myself
to the honored council of elders. (0:06:26.69)
▶ Emilia : My name is Emilia. (0:06:30.95)
▶ Emilia : I am accompanied by Puck, a great
spirit who controls fire, (0:06:33.13)
▶ Emilia : and I am a silver-haired half-elf. (0:06:36.77)
▶ EXTRA : A great spirit? (0:06:38.62)
▶ Emilia : I understand that my half-elf lineage, (0:06:42.90)
▶ Emilia : and other similarities to the witch,
subject me to prejudice. (0:06:44.67)
▶ Emilia : However... (0:06:48.62)
▶ Emilia : I adamantly refuse to let all my potential
be plucked out simply for that reason. (0:06:50.56)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : Emilia... (0:06:57.45)
▶ Miklotov : By the way... (0:06:59.89)
▶ Miklotov : What, exactly, is that young man's position? (0:07:01.22)
▶ Emilia : Huh? Um, well, he's... (0:07:05.08)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : It's okay, Emilia. I've made up my mind, too. (0:07:07.66)
▶ Emilia : Your mind? To do what? (0:07:11.48)
▶ Emilia : Hey, Subaru, what are you going to do? (0:07:13.60)
▶ Emilia : Wait! (0:07:16.17)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : Nice to meet you, members of
the council of elders. (0:07:18.77)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : My name is Natsuki Subaru. (0:07:22.37)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : I am a manservant in Roswaal's mansion,
and I serve as this candidate's... (0:07:24.45)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : Emilia-sama's best knight! (0:07:28.84)
▶ Miklotov : Hmm, a knight, is he? (0:07:34.91)
▶ Roswaal L. Mathers : Ah, he knows little of our world... (0:07:37.82)
▶ Julius Euclius : Forgive me for interrupting, (0:07:41.48)
▶ Julius Euclius : but there is something I must ask him... (0:07:44.01)
▶ Julius Euclius : If you truly proclaim yourself
to be Emilia-sama's knight. (0:07:48.14)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : What do you mean by that? (0:07:53.23)
▶ Julius Euclius : You just declared that you are a knight. (0:07:55.75)
▶ Julius Euclius : And you did so here, audaciously,
before the Knights of Lugunica! (0:08:00.08)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : That was pretty well-coordinated... (0:08:08.43)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : Did you guys practice that for this meeting? (0:08:10.81)
▶ Julius Euclius : Of course. (0:08:13.39)
▶ Julius Euclius : To make known to all the
dignity of our empire, (0:08:14.83)
▶ Julius Euclius : we are highly conscious of
our identities every day. (0:08:16.88)
▶ Julius Euclius : Do you have the resolve to match that? (0:08:19.96)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : I want to make Emilia-sama the ruler... (0:08:25.40)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : No, I will make her the ruler! (0:08:28.48)
▶ Julius Euclius : And you believe you have the
resolve and strength for that? (0:08:29.61)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : I don't have anything as grand as resolve, (0:08:34.14)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : and I'm well aware that I lack strength. (0:08:36.81)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : But I'm going to make Emilia the ruler! (0:08:38.95)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : I'm going to make her wish come true! (0:08:42.47)
▶ Julius Euclius : Do you not feel that your answer
is too arrogant by far? (0:08:45.50)
▶ Julius Euclius : Weakness is something to feel
shame, not pride, about. (0:08:50.19)
▶ Julius Euclius : To earn the right to stand here,
have you worked hard? (0:08:54.51)
▶ Julius Euclius : Have you done enough service to shame us, (0:08:58.21)
▶ Julius Euclius : the Imperial Knights? (0:09:01.72)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : I'm still going to make Emilia the ruler! (0:09:04.86)
▶ Julius Euclius : I fail to understand... (0:09:08.37)
▶ Julius Euclius : After being so denied, (0:09:10.24)
▶ Julius Euclius : why do you continue to stand here? (0:09:12.03)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : Because she's special! (0:09:19.95)
▶ Julius Euclius : I understand and accept your
reason for standing there. (0:09:25.51)
▶ Julius Euclius : But I do not think I can
acknowledge you as a knight. (0:09:28.95)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : What are you... (0:09:33.82)
▶ Julius Euclius : Anyone who inspires such an expression (0:09:36.52)
▶ Julius Euclius : on the face of one they wish to
stand beside, cannot be a knight. (0:09:39.41)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : I-Is being a knight that big a deal? (0:09:46.67)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : You just happened to be born into the job! (0:09:50.04)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : Don't act like a big-shot
with your daddy's name! (0:09:52.62)
▶ Julius Euclius : Natsuki Subaru, (0:09:54.93)
▶ Julius Euclius : that is not a beautiful look. (0:09:56.56)
▶ Emilia : That's enough, Subaru. (0:10:04.28)
▶ Emilia : I am deeply sorry to waste your time. (0:10:09.24)
▶ Emilia : I will make him stand down. (0:10:11.88)
▶ Miklotov : Emilia-sama, (0:10:16.23)
▶ Miklotov : if nothing else, he has shown us all
that you are not one to be feared. (0:10:17.90)
▶ Miklotov : You have a fine attendant. (0:10:24.29)
▶ Emilia : Subaru is (0:10:26.72)
▶ Emilia : not my attendant. (0:10:28.78)
▶ Marcos : Natsuki Subaru-dono, please leave the room. (0:10:35.07)
▶ Marcos : Now, let us discuss how the royal
selection will proceed. (0:10:45.66)
▶ Marcos : What's going on?! (0:10:51.58)
▶ Felt : What are you doing? (0:10:58.04)
▶ Felt : Old Man Rom! (0:11:04.15)
▶ Marcos : I don't know who you are, (0:11:11.91)
▶ Marcos : but for stealing into
the castle, you must die. (0:11:13.74)
▶ Felt : Stop! Let him go! (0:11:16.32)
▶ Marcos : Unfortunately, I cannot comply. (0:11:18.81)
▶ Marcos : You have publicly declared that (0:11:21.39)
▶ Marcos : you have no intention of participating
in the royal selection. (0:11:22.75)
▶ Marcos : I am not obligated to obey your orders. (0:11:27.31)
▶ Felt : Fine... (0:11:38.54)
▶ Felt : I'll do your stupid royal selection! (0:11:40.43)
▶ Felt : You want me to try to be
the next ruler, right? (0:11:42.64)
▶ Rom : Wh-What're you sayin', Felt? (0:11:46.12)
▶ Felt : That old man is my family, (0:11:48.97)
▶ Felt : so release him now. (0:11:51.47)
▶ Felt : Treat him with care! (0:11:53.20)
▶ Marcos : Very well. (0:11:54.88)
▶ Rom : Felt... I... (0:11:56.76)
▶ Felt : We'll talk later, Old Man Rom. (0:11:59.68)
▶ Felt : Hey, Reinhard, (0:12:06.80)
▶ Felt : was this all part of your plan, too? (0:12:08.25)
▶ Reinhard van Astrea : Certainly not. (0:12:11.45)
▶ Reinhard van Astrea : This was something far greater,
guided by fate. (0:12:13.16)
▶ Felt : Are you a slave to fate or something? (0:12:17.10)
▶ Reinhard van Astrea : No. (0:12:20.06)
▶ Reinhard van Astrea : From now on, I am your knight. (0:12:21.78)
▶ Felt : Fine, then. (0:12:25.24)
▶ Felt : I'll work you to death. (0:12:26.66)
▶ Miklotov : Anyway, Felt-sama and her knight, Reinhard, (0:12:30.01)
▶ Miklotov : may we conclude that you both intend
to participate in the royal selection? (0:12:33.39)
▶ Felt : Sure, I'm in. (0:12:38.64)
▶ Felt : But let me just say one thing. (0:12:40.00)
▶ Felt : I hate the nobility! (0:12:43.21)
▶ Felt : I hate knights! (0:12:45.74)
▶ Felt : I hate this kingdom! (0:12:48.17)
▶ Felt : I hate everything about it! (0:12:50.68)
▶ Felt : So I'm planning to tear it all down! (0:12:53.28)
▶ Felt : How about that? (0:12:57.74)
▶ Rickert : Wh-What are you saying? (0:12:59.79)
▶ Felt : If I become the next ruler, (0:13:03.16)
▶ Felt : I'll destroy everything! I'll take
down every last one of you, (0:13:04.99)
▶ Felt : and bring a little fresh
air into this country! (0:13:09.12)
▶ Miklotov : Your mistress is quite an intense lady. (0:13:13.82)
▶ Reinhard van Astrea : One day, Felt-sama's words
will reach everyone's ears. (0:13:17.15)
▶ Miklotov : In any case, (0:13:23.29)
▶ Miklotov : all of the candidates are finally here. (0:13:24.60)
▶ Miklotov : The royal selection will now begin! (0:13:30.26)
▶ Reinhard van Astrea : And so, the royal selection
has finally begun, Subaru. (0:13:36.74)
▶ Felix Argyle : Subaru-kyun , you're Emilia-sama's
knight nyow , aren't you? (0:13:40.81)
▶ Felix Argyle : Let's both do our best. (0:13:44.13)
▶ Julius Euclius : Forgive me for interrupting. (0:13:46.75)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : Why the hell are you here?! (0:13:49.97)
▶ Julius Euclius : I wish you would not make
such an unpleasant face. (0:13:52.56)
▶ Julius Euclius : I didn't expect you to warmly welcome me, (0:13:55.92)
▶ Julius Euclius : but if you take that attitude— (0:13:58.68)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : If I do, then what? (0:14:00.61)
▶ Julius Euclius : It will call into question the respectability
of those in your company. (0:14:02.97)
▶ Julius Euclius : Do be careful. (0:14:06.46)
▶ Julius Euclius : Now, you asked me why
I was here, did you not? (0:14:09.96)
▶ Julius Euclius : I came to see you, of course. (0:14:14.97)
▶ Julius Euclius : I would like you to come with me for a bit. (0:14:17.16)
▶ Reinhard van Astrea : Julius, you shouldn't do this. (0:14:25.16)
▶ Reinhard van Astrea : It isn't like you. (0:14:27.61)
▶ Julius Euclius : He insulted us, the knights, before the
candidates to be our future ruler. (0:14:28.81)
▶ Julius Euclius : And he mocked the chivalry we practice. (0:14:33.28)
▶ Reinhard van Astrea : I admit that he said some
things that went too far. (0:14:36.69)
▶ Reinhard van Astrea : But for such a matter, he need
only be warned and corrected. (0:14:40.22)
▶ Julius Euclius : No, this is not only my problem. (0:14:44.08)
▶ Julius Euclius : I hereby administer (0:14:48.80)
▶ Julius Euclius : the death penalty to this insubordinate man,
who sullied the knighthood's honor! (0:14:49.68)
▶ Julius Euclius : Normally, it wouldn't be unusual
for you to be slain for insolence. (0:14:55.58)
▶ Julius Euclius : However, much to my dismay,
you are Emilia-sama's attendant. (0:14:59.68)
▶ Julius Euclius : Therefore, we will fight using wooden swords. (0:15:03.74)
▶ Julius Euclius : Shall we begin? (0:15:08.73)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : Sure, I'm not gonna hold back! (0:15:11.03)
▶ Julius Euclius : It appears you truly have no pride. (0:15:23.73)
▶ Julius Euclius : What a simple, vulgar way to live. (0:15:27.31)
▶ EXTRA : Reporting! (0:15:36.66)
▶ EXTRA : Knights Julius and Natsuki Subaru-dono
are having a mock battle (0:15:38.08)
▶ EXTRA : with wooden swords in the training ring! (0:15:41.41)
▶ Emilia : How did that happen? I have to— (0:15:44.59)
▶ Anastasia Hoshin : I just wanna know one thing... (0:15:47.26)
▶ Anastasia Hoshin : Which one of 'em issued the challenge? (0:15:49.30)
▶ EXTRA : I'm told it was the knight Julius. (0:15:52.64)
▶ EXTRA : Natsuki Subaru-dono accepted, (0:15:54.90)
▶ EXTRA : leading to this fight. (0:15:57.23)
▶ Anastasia Hoshin : Well, I'm against stopping them, then. (0:15:58.81)
▶ Emilia : But your knight and my,
um... friend are fighting. (0:16:01.52)
▶ Emilia : Aren't you worried? (0:16:06.03)
▶ Anastasia Hoshin : Worried? About what? (0:16:07.67)
▶ Anastasia Hoshin : That Julius will go too far, (0:16:09.50)
▶ Anastasia Hoshin : and I'll have to pay for your boy's treatment? (0:16:11.07)
▶ Crusch Karsten : If it is a question of the mock battle, (0:16:14.10)
▶ Crusch Karsten : I cannot agree with stopping
it before they finish, either. (0:16:16.47)
▶ Felt : If they're just duking it out, (0:16:19.16)
▶ Felt : you could've waited until it ended
and told us who won. (0:16:21.18)
▶ EXTRA : Yes, ma'am! But the fight was, well... (0:16:23.48)
▶ EXTRA : It was just so one-sided, I... (0:16:26.90)
▶ Emilia : I have to stop it! (0:16:29.44)
▶ Aldebaran : We should go, too. (0:16:31.48)
▶ Aldebaran : You like to watch vicious beasts torment
weak creatures, don't you? (0:16:32.91)
▶ Priscilla Barielle : Don't misjudge me with your
unfounded imaginings, Al... (0:16:37.85)
▶ Priscilla Barielle : But yes, I do love that. (0:16:41.87)
▶ Julius Euclius : Why don't you admit that you
have reached your limit? (0:16:46.74)
▶ Julius Euclius : I'm sure you have now realized,
to a painful extent, (0:16:50.24)
▶ Julius Euclius : just what the knights that you insulted,
and made light of, really are! (0:16:53.26)
▶ Julius Euclius : I believe continuing would endanger your life. (0:17:02.44)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : Damn it. (0:17:05.39)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : I'll break... (0:17:06.83)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : that nose of yours. (0:17:09.85)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : I'll crush you. (0:17:11.67)
▶ Emilia : Subaru! (0:17:17.29)
▶ Emilia : Don't, Subaru! (0:17:20.97)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : Shamac! (0:17:21.91)
▶ Julius Euclius : This was the ace up your sleeve? (0:17:29.21)
▶ Julius Euclius : Your skill level is far too low. (0:17:33.71)
▶ Julius Euclius : Such low-level magic (0:17:35.62)
▶ Julius Euclius : will only work on unintelligent beasts! (0:17:37.39)
▶ Julius Euclius : You are irredeemably powerless. (0:17:42.25)
▶ Julius Euclius : You are not worthy to stand at her side. (0:17:45.95)
▶ Emilia : Subaru! (0:17:48.98)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : So I didn't die... (0:18:02.77)
▶ Emilia : Subaru. (0:18:08.89)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : That talk with the royal candidates... (0:18:09.54)
▶ Emilia : Subaru. (0:18:11.59)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : I see. (0:18:13.22)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : Then let's head straight back. (0:18:14.76)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : We need to work out a plan for the selec— (0:18:16.78)
▶ Emilia : Subaru. (0:18:18.40)
▶ Emilia : Let's talk, okay? (0:18:20.79)
▶ Emilia : I have some things I want to ask you. (0:18:23.39)
▶ Emilia : A lot of things. (0:18:26.29)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : Yeah, I guess you do... (0:18:29.34)
▶ Emilia : Why did you end up, well, fighting Julius? (0:18:31.53)
▶ Emilia : There must have been a reason, right? (0:18:35.84)
▶ Emilia : Knowing you, it must've been important— (0:18:38.14)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : I wanted to get him back! (0:18:40.06)
▶ Emilia : Huh? (0:18:42.69)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : I was being stubborn. (0:18:43.61)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : He said I was pathetic, powerless,
and unworthy of you. (0:18:45.84)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : He was trying to distance me
from you, and I hated it. (0:18:49.66)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : That's why I fought him. (0:18:53.68)
▶ Emilia : Just for that? (0:18:55.58)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : Emilia-tan... (0:18:59.63)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : Emilia, you wouldn't understand. (0:19:02.56)
▶ Emilia : I see. (0:19:06.25)
▶ Emilia : Roswaal and I will return to
the mansion tomorrow. (0:19:07.64)
▶ Emilia : You will stay in the capital to recover. (0:19:11.81)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : Wait a minute. (0:19:14.02)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : Huh? (0:19:15.42)
▶ Emilia : Wasn't that our agreement? (0:19:16.35)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : But wait a— (0:19:17.84)
▶ Emilia : You came to the capital so Felis
could heal your exhausted gate. (0:19:19.07)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : No, wait a minute! (0:19:23.56)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : How can you suddenly... I... (0:19:25.26)
▶ Emilia : Because... (0:19:27.43)
▶ Emilia : When I'm with you, you always push
yourself to do the impossible. (0:19:30.11)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : That's not what I'm saying... I just— (0:19:34.19)
▶ Emilia : "Just"? (0:19:37.94)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : I just wanted to do something for you, so I... (0:19:39.05)
▶ Emilia : For me? (0:19:43.45)
▶ Emilia : It was for you, wasn't it? (0:19:48.19)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : No... I just wanted to do something for you— (0:19:51.21)
▶ Emilia : Stop telling lies about how
everything is for my sake! (0:19:58.57)
▶ Emilia : Coming to the castle,
fighting Julius, using magic... (0:20:04.59)
▶ Emilia : Are you saying that was all for me? (0:20:09.07)
▶ Emilia : I never asked you to do any of that! (0:20:11.45)
▶ Emilia : Hey, do you remember
what I asked you to do? (0:20:14.94)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : I... (0:20:19.11)
▶ Emilia : I asked you to wait at the lodging with Rem. (0:20:20.39)
▶ Emilia : I asked you not to use magic because
using more would endanger you. (0:20:24.69)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : I'm sorry I didn't do as you asked. (0:20:29.23)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : B-But you're wrong. You're wrong! (0:20:32.06)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : I... I didn't do it for myself. (0:20:34.09)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : You won't believe me, Emilia? (0:20:39.42)
▶ Emilia : I want to. (0:20:44.03)
▶ Emilia : I want to believe you, Subaru. (0:20:46.09)
▶ Emilia : I want to... (0:20:48.52)
▶ Emilia : But you're the one who won't
give me a reason to! (0:20:50.83)
▶ Emilia : You promised me... (0:20:57.62)
▶ Emilia : But just like that, you threw it away,
and came all the way here! (0:21:00.06)
▶ Emilia : You won't keep your promise to me, (0:21:05.70)
▶ Emilia : and you ask me to believe you? (0:21:08.03)
▶ Emilia : I can't do that! I can't! (0:21:12.36)
▶ Emilia : Hey, Subaru... (0:21:18.06)
▶ Emilia : Why do you keep trying to help me like this? (0:21:19.93)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : Because you helped me... (0:21:24.94)
▶ Emilia : I... helped you? (0:21:28.19)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : Yes. (0:21:31.60)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : You don't even realize (0:21:34.13)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : how the things you've done
for me have saved me. (0:21:36.70)
▶ Emilia : No, I don't, Subaru. (0:21:40.70)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : I don't expect you to... (0:21:43.20)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : But it's true! You saved me! (0:21:45.31)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : So everything I've done has been to repay you. (0:21:48.48)
▶ Emilia : I told you, I don't understand! (0:21:51.69)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : Maybe you don't, but please listen to me! (0:21:54.43)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : It's the truth! (0:21:58.14)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : You were the... (0:22:00.09)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : When I first came to this world, you were— (0:22:01.35)
▶ Emilia : Once again, you won't tell me anything. (0:22:07.89)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : Why won't you understand? (0:22:11.67)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : I thought (0:22:15.07)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : if anyone could understand... (0:22:16.28)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : it'd be you. (0:22:19.71)
▶ Emilia : The version of me that lives within
you must be amazing. (0:22:21.87)
▶ Emilia : She can understand everything, (0:22:26.12)
▶ Emilia : even if you don't explain it to her. (0:22:28.97)
▶ Emilia : She can feel all your pain, sadness,
and anger as her own. (0:22:31.89)
▶ Emilia : I can't understand if you
don't tell me, Subaru. (0:22:39.96)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : I've... (0:22:46.18)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : All this time, (0:22:49.55)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : haven't I made everything work out all right?! (0:22:52.78)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : When your insignia was stolen, I saved you
from an insane killer at the loot house! (0:22:56.68)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : I risked my life! (0:23:00.81)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : All because you were important to me! (0:23:02.52)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : At the mansion, too. (0:23:04.83)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : Things worked out because of me. (0:23:06.11)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : Without me, it would've been a lot worse. (0:23:07.96)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : All of it, all of it, all of it! (0:23:10.36)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : All of it was because I was there! (0:23:12.20)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : You should have a greater debt to me
than you could ever repay! (0:23:15.40)
▶ Emilia : You're right. (0:23:21.76)
▶ Emilia : I owe you so many debts, Subaru. (0:23:23.98)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : Yeah, that's right! That's why I... (0:23:29.84)
▶ Emilia : So I'll repay all of them now. (0:23:33.41)
▶ Emilia : And we'll end this. (0:23:37.49)
▶ Emilia : You've done enough, Natsuki Subaru. (0:23:42.44)
▶ Emilia : You know, I had hopes for you. (0:23:46.94)
▶ Emilia : I thought maybe you... (0:23:51.06)
▶ Emilia : That only you wouldn't give
me special treatment. (0:23:53.71)
▶ Emilia : That you'd look at me (0:23:57.93)
▶ Emilia : in the same, exact way you
look at everyone else. (0:23:59.08)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : I can't do that. (0:24:04.30)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : I can't look at you the way I look at others. (0:24:07.40)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : It's impossible. (0:24:12.19)▶ Subaru Natsuki : Haven't I made everything work out all right?! (0:00:20.00)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : Without me, it would've been a lot worse. (0:00:24.46)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : All of it was because I was there! (0:00:26.71)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : You should have a greater debt to me
than you could ever repay! (0:00:30.73)
▶ Wilhelm van Astrea : Shall we stop for now? (0:00:42.94)
▶ Emilia : So I'll repay all of them now. (0:00:45.97)
▶ Emilia : And we'll end this. (0:00:48.57)
▶ Felix Argyle : I swear, Julius, your good
nature is going to waste, (0:00:56.86)
▶ Felix Argyle : playing the villain for someone like him. (0:00:59.80)
▶ Julius Euclius : I haven't the slightest idea
what you're talking about. (0:01:02.48)
▶ Felix Argyle : How could you get yourself punished,
trying to protect a guy like that? (0:01:06.45)
▶ Felix Argyle : It's foolish! (0:01:09.45)
▶ Julius Euclius : I only acted as I wished,
true to my own nature. (0:01:10.65)
▶ Julius Euclius : Righteously, in my own way, (0:01:13.47)
▶ Julius Euclius : and without shame, as I wished. (0:01:16.34)
▶ Felix Argyle : Are you sure about this? (0:01:20.99)
▶ Felix Argyle : Old Man Wil is busy preparing, too... (0:01:22.60)
▶ Crusch Karsten : It was a request from our guest. (0:01:25.94)
▶ Crusch Karsten : I cannot ignore it. (0:01:27.92)
▶ Felix Argyle : If they're just practicing,
it's nyo big deal, but... (0:01:29.71)
▶ Felix Argyle : Frankly, it appears to me
he's just making excuses. (0:01:32.59)
▶ Crusch Karsten : Excuses? (0:01:37.32)
▶ Felix Argyle : He wants to say, "I'm just
fine. I'm working hard." (0:01:38.67)
▶ Crusch Karsten : Can you blame him? (0:01:44.17)
▶ Reinhard van Astrea : Forgive me. (0:03:24.81)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : Hang on... (0:03:26.36)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : What do you have to apologize for? (0:03:27.57)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : None of this was your fault! (0:03:30.80)
▶ Reinhard van Astrea : No, I am a friend to you,
as well as to Julius. (0:03:34.20)
▶ Reinhard van Astrea : My own lack of virtue was
responsible for my failure (0:03:38.81)
▶ Reinhard van Astrea : to stop a disagreement between my two friends. (0:03:41.71)
▶ Reinhard van Astrea : That duel had no meaning. (0:03:44.86)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : No meaning? (0:03:48.46)
▶ Reinhard van Astrea : No... (0:03:51.16)
▶ Reinhard van Astrea : What came of you two fighting there? (0:03:52.35)
▶ Reinhard van Astrea : You were hurt, (0:03:55.11)
▶ Reinhard van Astrea : and Julius tarnished his own career. (0:03:56.67)
▶ Reinhard van Astrea : Why not try to have a calm,
open discussion with him? (0:04:00.76)
▶ Reinhard van Astrea : I'm sure that will clear up the misunder— (0:04:04.75)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : Reinhard. (0:04:06.14)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : I get how you feel, and I appreciate it. (0:04:08.13)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : You really are a nice guy. (0:04:11.66)
▶ Reinhard van Astrea : Then... (0:04:13.36)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : But I can't accept that proposal! (0:04:14.07)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : We're done talking. (0:04:16.54)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : Go back now. (0:04:17.93)
▶ Reinhard van Astrea : Subaru... (0:04:19.96)
▶ Reinhard van Astrea : Why? (0:04:21.43)
▶ Reinhard van Astrea : What did you gain from that duel? (0:04:22.66)
▶ Reinhard van Astrea : You've only suffered losses. (0:04:24.91)
▶ Reinhard van Astrea : Even Emilia-sama— (0:04:27.09)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : You'd better head back for today, Reinhard. (0:04:28.08)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : Before your mistress gets lonely
and starts yelling for you. (0:04:30.96)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : Mind your own damn business. (0:04:40.75)
▶ Wilhelm van Astrea : Shall we stop for now? (0:04:51.95)
▶ Rem : You must be tired after practice, Subaru-kun. (0:05:03.85)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : Rem, you don't think I'm pathetic? (0:05:10.14)
▶ Rem : I do. (0:05:14.89)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : You do? Seriously? (0:05:16.78)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : Then why are you still here
with a pathetic loser like me? (0:05:18.78)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : Because you were told to? (0:05:22.01)
▶ Rem : The fact that I think you're pathetic (0:05:23.65)
▶ Rem : and my staying with you are not contradictory. (0:05:25.32)
▶ Rem : Besides, even if I had not been ordered to, (0:05:28.69)
▶ Rem : I'm certain I would have stayed. (0:05:31.31)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : Why? (0:05:34.17)
▶ Rem : Because I want to. (0:05:36.55)
▶ Rem : Shall we go out tomorrow, Subaru-kun? (0:05:40.84)
▶ Rem : You haven't gone anywhere in the
three days since we arrived. (0:05:44.54)
▶ Kadomon Risch : Interested in the royal selection, too? (0:05:59.18)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : Whoa! Don't sneak up on me with that face! (0:06:01.27)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : Wait, where's Rem? (0:06:04.54)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : Don't make someone without
experience watch your shop. (0:06:11.32)
▶ Kadomon Risch : Five candidates, huh? (0:06:14.17)
▶ Kadomon Risch : If you ask me, letting a half-elf be
one of them is pure insanity. (0:06:16.83)
▶ Kadomon Risch : "Emilia," eh? (0:06:21.71)
▶ Kadomon Risch : There's no way a relative of the
witch could become our ruler. (0:06:23.56)
▶ Kadomon Risch : They've gotta be crazy. (0:06:26.75)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : Why does everyone say that? (0:06:29.67)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : It doesn't mean she has anything
to do with the witch! (0:06:30.95)
▶ Kadomon Risch : Huh? (0:06:34.64)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : Just because she's a half-elf,
don't lump them together (0:06:36.01)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : and brush her off! (0:06:38.57)
▶ Kadomon Risch : H-Hey... (0:06:40.30)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : That Emilia girl... I mean... (0:06:41.79)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : She might really care about this
kingdom's people, too! (0:06:45.15)
▶ Kadomon Risch : Hang on, why are you getting so worked up? (0:06:48.67)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : I... (0:06:50.72)
▶ Emilia : It was for you, wasn't it? (0:06:52.03)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : Why is it... (0:06:55.97)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : Because of the Jealous Witch? (0:06:57.16)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : You think all half-elves are dangerous, (0:06:58.84)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : just because the witch was one?! (0:07:01.39)
▶ Kadomon Risch : That's right! (0:07:03.94)
▶ Kadomon Risch : Everyone's scared of the witch. (0:07:05.93)
▶ Kadomon Risch : That's common knowledge. (0:07:07.40)
▶ Kadomon Risch : As long as people see her that way, (0:07:12.40)
▶ Kadomon Risch : she can't win. (0:07:14.57)
▶ Kadomon Risch : Jeez, (0:07:17.93)
▶ Kadomon Risch : who would actually choose to support her? (0:07:19.22)
▶ Kadomon Risch : Try not to say the word "witch"
too loudly in public. (0:07:26.00)
▶ Kadomon Risch : You never know who's listening, or where. (0:07:30.19)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : You didn't tell me (0:07:39.84)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : everyone felt that way about you... (0:07:43.11)
▶ Emilia : I can't understand if you
don't tell me, Subaru. (0:07:46.03)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : I can't understand if you
don't tell me, either. (0:07:49.70)
▶ Crusch Karsten : Natsuki Subaru, would you
mind joining me for a bit? (0:08:16.92)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : Crusch-san... Right? (0:08:20.52)
▶ Crusch Karsten : That's right. (0:08:22.80)
▶ Crusch Karsten : Oh, yes... (0:08:24.76)
▶ Crusch Karsten : This is the first time you've seen
me out of business attire. (0:08:25.92)
▶ Crusch Karsten : The breeze is pleasantly cool tonight. (0:08:30.20)
▶ Crusch Karsten : Perfect conditions for sharing a drink, (0:08:32.76)
▶ Crusch Karsten : as we gaze upon the night sky. (0:08:35.11)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : But I can't drink alcohol. (0:08:40.19)
▶ Crusch Karsten : You're welcome to drink water. (0:08:42.88)
▶ Crusch Karsten : I won't be drinking enough to get drunk. (0:08:45.11)
▶ Crusch Karsten : How goes the healing of your gate? (0:08:59.32)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : H-Hey! (0:09:03.82)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : Oh... (0:09:05.55)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : Oh... Well, it goes, I guess... (0:09:07.21)
▶ Crusch Karsten : I see. (0:09:10.03)
▶ Crusch Karsten : Well, Felis is excellent with healing magic. (0:09:10.81)
▶ Crusch Karsten : You can trust him. (0:09:14.00)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : You always seem busy, too. (0:09:19.20)
▶ Crusch Karsten : In response to a certain occurrence, (0:09:22.45)
▶ Crusch Karsten : my family is currently gathering
people and objects. (0:09:23.81)
▶ Crusch Karsten : Plus, since word of the
royal selection spread, (0:09:28.41)
▶ Crusch Karsten : I've received proposals every day. (0:09:31.21)
▶ Crusch Karsten : I'm sure the other candidates have, as well. (0:09:33.54)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : P-Proposals?! (0:09:35.47)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : You mean, as in marriage? (0:09:36.84)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : Oh, yeah. (0:09:39.54)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : I guess they're all single... (0:09:40.67)
▶ Crusch Karsten : Does that bother you? (0:09:43.30)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : Not really. It's just... (0:09:44.99)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : Oh, right! (0:09:47.52)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : Wilhelm-san said he had a beautiful wife. (0:09:48.41)
▶ Crusch Karsten : Are you aware that Wilhelm serves me? (0:09:53.87)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : Huh? Why? (0:09:58.99)
▶ Felix Argyle : What are nyou doing here, Subaru-kyun ? (0:10:02.38)
▶ Felix Argyle : And Crusch-sama! (0:10:05.26)
▶ Felix Argyle : Why are you dressed so vulnerably?! (0:10:06.77)
▶ Crusch Karsten : Is it strange? (0:10:08.86)
▶ Crusch Karsten : It's no different than what
I wear to dine with you. (0:10:10.43)
▶ Felix Argyle : That's exactly the problem! (0:10:12.96)
▶ Felix Argyle : Men are nyo thing but wolves! (0:10:15.94)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : You're a man, too. (0:10:18.13)
▶ Crusch Karsten : That's enough joking, Felis. (0:10:20.35)
▶ Crusch Karsten : All who were present at the royal selection (0:10:22.48)
▶ Crusch Karsten : know whom Subaru loves. (0:10:25.60)
▶ Felix Argyle : Yeah. I heard they had a fight, though. (0:10:28.14)
▶ Felix Argyle : I swear, Subaru-kyun , you're so easy to read! (0:10:31.57)
▶ Crusch Karsten : Don't cast your gaze down, Natsuki Subaru. (0:10:36.98)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : Huh? (0:10:39.23)
▶ Crusch Karsten : When your eyes are clouded, your soul darkens. (0:10:40.20)
▶ Crusch Karsten : That means your future is closed to you, (0:10:42.98)
▶ Crusch Karsten : and you lose sight of your reasons to live. (0:10:45.02)
▶ Crusch Karsten : When you do what you know to be right, (0:10:47.77)
▶ Crusch Karsten : what can you do by looking downward? (0:10:50.04)
▶ Crusch Karsten : Lift your head, face forward, (0:10:53.58)
▶ Crusch Karsten : and reach out your hands. (0:10:55.82)
▶ Crusch Karsten : I do not want to regard you
as an insignificant enemy. (0:10:57.38)
▶ Felix Argyle : If Crusch-sama says so, (0:11:02.49)
▶ Felix Argyle : you have nyo choice. (0:11:04.52)
▶ Felix Argyle : The point is, Subaru-kyun , you need to
hurry and make up with Emilia-sama. (0:11:06.76)
▶ Felix Argyle : Think about what you can do (0:11:11.40)
▶ Felix Argyle : to accomplish that, and do it. (0:11:13.54)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : What I can do? (0:11:18.74)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : There is something I can do. (0:11:27.08)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : Something that only I can do. (0:11:33.94)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : Yeah, that's right... (0:11:37.07)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : You don't even have to tell me. (0:11:38.83)
▶ Crusch Karsten : The wind is picking up. (0:11:45.58)
▶ Crusch Karsten : It looks as if the weather will
be rough again tomorrow. (0:11:48.35)
▶ Wilhelm van Astrea : Shall we stop for now? (0:11:58.08)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : Don't be silly... (0:12:00.48)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : You've seen how far I've come in taking blows! (0:12:02.36)
▶ Wilhelm van Astrea : Your attitude seems quite
different this morning. (0:12:05.62)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : Last night, Crusch-san gave
me some good advice. (0:12:09.64)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : If I just get a chance, I can make
any problem disappear! (0:12:14.81)
▶ Wilhelm van Astrea : Then, let us call it a day. (0:12:20.99)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : Huh? (0:12:24.22)
▶ Wilhelm van Astrea : Well, I think teaching swordsmanship,
which will make a man stronger, (0:12:25.50)
▶ Wilhelm van Astrea : to one who has abandoned the option
to get stronger seems meaningless. (0:12:29.53)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : What do you... (0:12:36.12)
▶ Rem : Subaru-kun! (0:12:38.14)
▶ Rem : We must discuss something important. (0:12:41.50)
▶ Crusch Karsten : Has Rem told you what's going on? (0:12:46.07)
▶ Rem : What I felt was... (0:12:48.88)
▶ Rem : Something like a presence,
through the sense I share with my sister. (0:12:50.40)
▶ Rem : My sister could have used (0:12:54.41)
▶ Rem : her clairvoyance to get a
clearer picture, but I... (0:12:55.98)
▶ Felix Argyle : So I guess you picked up a nya sty sort
of synesthesia from her, huh? (0:12:58.56)
▶ Crusch Karsten : We don't know the details, either. (0:13:02.81)
▶ Crusch Karsten : But it came from the Mathers domain, (0:13:05.32)
▶ Crusch Karsten : which you know as Margrave
Roswaal's territory. (0:13:06.62)
▶ Crusch Karsten : Evidently, some troubling movement was
seen in the vicinity of his mansion. (0:13:09.89)
▶ Crusch Karsten : Parts of the domain are already on high alert. (0:13:14.31)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : Troubling movement? (0:13:17.59)
▶ Crusch Karsten : We did foresee this situation. (0:13:19.57)
▶ Crusch Karsten : From the moment the margrave declared
his intention to back Emilia, a half-elf. (0:13:22.26)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : You mean there's trouble happening
because of that prejudice? (0:13:28.24)
▶ Crusch Karsten : That is likely a correct summation. (0:13:31.95)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : The moment I leave her side, this happens? (0:13:36.08)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : Everyone around her is an enemy. (0:13:40.18)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : The only one who can take her side... (0:13:42.78)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : is me. (0:13:47.31)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : Well, then... (0:13:49.69)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : We have to go and help, right? (0:13:51.47)
▶ Rem : Y-You mustn't, Subaru-kun. (0:13:54.40)
▶ Rem : You have to obey Emilia-sama's orders. (0:13:56.49)
▶ Rem : She told you to focus on healing! (0:13:58.89)
▶ Rem : And I agree! (0:14:01.28)
▶ Rem : Healing must take priority now. (0:14:02.82)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : Rem, we're the only ones (0:14:05.92)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : who can take Emilia's side! (0:14:09.27)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : You heard that, Crusch-san. (0:14:13.68)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : We're going back to the mansion,
back to where Emilia is. (0:14:16.14)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : Until it's taken care of, my healing will— (0:14:19.72)
▶ Crusch Karsten : Natsuki Subaru. (0:14:21.32)
▶ Crusch Karsten : If you leave here, (0:14:23.07)
▶ Crusch Karsten : that will make you my enemy. (0:14:25.00)
▶ Crusch Karsten : Allow me to correct one idea you have. (0:14:28.62)
▶ Crusch Karsten : I have only allowed you to stay here
as a guest, receiving treatment, (0:14:31.74)
▶ Crusch Karsten : because I am contracted to do so. (0:14:35.08)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : Contracted? (0:14:37.26)
▶ Crusch Karsten : Emilia and I formed a contract (0:14:38.74)
▶ Crusch Karsten : regarding your treatment. (0:14:41.92)
▶ Crusch Karsten : However, (0:14:44.03)
▶ Crusch Karsten : if you abandon that contract yourself, (0:14:45.44)
▶ Crusch Karsten : I am not obligated to continue protecting you. (0:14:47.89)
▶ Crusch Karsten : The moment you leave this household, (0:14:50.22)
▶ Crusch Karsten : Emilia and I will not hesitate
to become enemies. (0:14:52.27)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : I was wrong about you. (0:14:56.67)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : I thought, just maybe,
you and I could get along. (0:14:59.26)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : Yeah, of course... That was just a
little joke over drinks, right? (0:15:03.32)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : I was stupid to take you seriously (0:15:07.28)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : when you told me,
an enemy, to do what I could. (0:15:09.06)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : You don't want me to leave
because getting Emilia (0:15:12.48)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : out of trouble will be bad for you, right? (0:15:14.83)
▶ Felix Argyle : Nyow I think you have it all wrong— (0:15:17.42)
▶ Crusch Karsten : Felis, enough. (0:15:19.53)
▶ Felix Argyle : No, I will say it. (0:15:20.49)
▶ Felix Argyle : The mistake he's making is a bit too grave. (0:15:21.82)
▶ Felix Argyle : Even if you leave, nothing will change. (0:15:25.13)
▶ Felix Argyle : You'd be wasting your time. (0:15:28.35)
▶ Felix Argyle : After making a fool of yourself at the castle (0:15:29.77)
▶ Felix Argyle : and being clobbered by Julius,
nyou still don't realize that? (0:15:32.05)
▶ Felix Argyle : If you stay to finish your treatment,
you'll be much better off. (0:15:35.41)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : I've decided. I'm going back to Emilia. (0:15:41.46)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : Though it wasn't for long,
thanks for taking care of me. (0:15:45.06)
▶ Felix Argyle : Is it nyot true that a good man (0:15:47.66)
▶ Felix Argyle : knows how to take a warning? (0:15:49.81)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : It's thanks to your warning that
I've made up my mind. (0:15:51.76)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : Thank you. (0:15:55.23)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : Rem, how long until we reach the mansion? (0:16:00.42)
▶ Rem : About two and a half days, I think. (0:16:02.59)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : Over two days? (0:16:04.92)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : It took less than half a day to get here! (0:16:06.07)
▶ Rem : We cannot go that way. (0:16:08.03)
▶ Rem : There is a fog over the road, (0:16:09.08)
▶ Rem : so we need to take a detour. (0:16:11.45)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : Who cares about fog? (0:16:12.95)
▶ Rem : The fog is created by the White Whale. (0:16:14.63)
▶ Rem : Should we encounter it, (0:16:16.71)
▶ Rem : we would not survive. (0:16:18.78)
▶ Rem : Thank you for lending us your
dragon-drawn carriage. (0:16:27.21)
▶ Rem : In my master's stead, I offer my gratitude for (0:16:31.07)
▶ Rem : the favor you have shown us till today. (0:16:33.78)
▶ Wilhelm van Astrea : It's nothing. Please take care. (0:16:36.08)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : Are you getting anything from Ram? (0:16:42.84)
▶ Rem : No, our shared sense is consciously
controlled, to an extent. (0:16:45.08)
▶ Rem : This morning, I think (0:16:49.64)
▶ Rem : that what I sensed was something
that exceeded my sister's control. (0:16:50.99)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : So Ram didn't even mean
to let us know about it... (0:16:55.77)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : Is she trying to keep
us from getting involved? (0:17:02.54)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : But why? (0:17:06.38)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : She needs me by her side... (0:17:08.08)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : I can save her. (0:17:12.75)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : Once I do, I'm sure she'll understand. (0:17:14.96)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : She has to. (0:17:17.95)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : Why are we stopping? (0:17:34.06)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : We have to hurry. (0:17:35.48)
▶ Rem : I'm sorry, Subaru-kun. (0:17:36.78)
▶ Rem : The ground dragon cannot go any farther. (0:17:38.48)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : I can't sleep. (0:17:51.60)
▶ Rem : Subaru-kun, are you awake? (0:17:55.08)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : Yeah. (0:17:57.55)
▶ Rem : I cannot sleep, (0:18:07.29)
▶ Rem : so I hoped we could talk. (0:18:08.67)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : Oh... You, too? (0:18:10.81)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : Can't help that, I guess. (0:18:13.87)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : You're really worried about the mansion (0:18:21.63)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : after what you felt through your shared sense? (0:18:23.61)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : It'll be fine. (0:18:28.21)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : We're not the sort of lovable little kids
to get our feelings hurt so easily. (0:18:30.02)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : We'll get right back, and I'll fix things. (0:18:33.66)
▶ Rem : Yes, I have put all my faith
in you, Subaru-kun. (0:18:39.46)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : R-Rem-san, um, (0:18:54.50)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : why are you holding on to me? (0:18:57.02)
▶ Rem : Because I want to. (0:19:00.66)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : I... I know this feeling... (0:19:07.00)
▶ Rem : I am healing your gate, (0:19:11.12)
▶ Rem : just as Felix-sama did, Subaru-kun. (0:19:12.92)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : O-Oh, healing! (0:19:15.87)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : You're healing me... Of course you are. (0:19:17.68)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : Because you want to, huh? (0:19:22.95)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : She'll probably be angry with
me at first, won't she? (0:19:27.00)
▶ Rem : If you take the time to properly face her (0:19:32.41)
▶ Rem : and communicate how you feel with words, (0:19:36.26)
▶ Rem : I'm sure she will understand. (0:19:39.36)
▶ Rem : You are a wonderful person, after all. (0:19:41.67)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : I am? (0:19:45.10)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : Yeah... I am, right? (0:19:47.85)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : Emilia is hopeless without me. (0:19:50.99)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : Because I (0:19:55.52)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : care about her... so much... (0:19:57.98)
▶ Rem : So save just a tiny bit of that for me, too. (0:20:06.26)
▶ Rem : Don't go anywhere. Okay, Subaru-kun? (0:20:14.05)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : Rem, wake up! We oversle— (0:20:25.42)
▶ EXTRA : Well, now! Good morni— (0:20:33.29)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : Where's the blue-haired girl
who was here with me?! (0:20:35.69)
▶ EXTRA : Th-The lady you were with, u-uh— (0:20:38.59)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : I can't hear you! (0:20:41.06)
▶ EXTRA : I was saying that she left during the night. (0:20:41.95)
▶ EXTRA : Here are your things... (0:20:45.39)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : What the hell? (0:20:53.07)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : What are you thinking, Rem? (0:20:54.45)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : I thought that you would understand me... (0:20:57.62)

▶ Petelgeuse Romanee-Conti : But you fell before your
feelings reached him, (0:18:00.14)
▶ Petelgeuse Romanee-Conti : and your love had nowhere to go... (0:18:02.66)
▶ Petelgeuse Romanee-Conti : You are truly slothful! (0:18:06.48)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : I'll kill you! I'll kill you!
I'll kill you! I'll kill you! (0:18:09.85)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : I'll kill you. (0:18:26.68)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : I'll kill you. I'll kill you. I'll kill you. (0:18:27.80)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : I'll kill you... I'll kill you. (0:18:31.38)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : I'll kill you. I'll kill you.
I'll kill you. I'll kill you. (0:18:34.02)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : Rem? (0:18:51.80)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : Rem... (0:18:57.49)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : Rem... Rem! (0:19:04.65)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : Rem... Rem... (0:19:06.88)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : Rem! Rem! (0:19:09.64)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : Rem! (0:19:11.88)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : Rem... Hey, Rem! (0:19:21.31)
▶ Rem : Hu... (0:19:24.69)
▶ Rem : ...ma. (0:19:27.00)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : Rem, you... (0:19:31.23)
▶ Rem : Live... (0:19:33.93)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : Rem... Wait, don't! (0:19:37.68)
▶ Rem : Live... (0:19:47.20)
▶ Rem : Love... you... (0:19:51.71)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : Rem? (0:19:59.20)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : Let's go, Rem. (0:20:22.22)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : Betelgeuse... (0:20:52.16)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : Betelgeuse... (0:20:57.71)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : Betelgeuse... (0:21:21.33)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : Betelgeuse! (0:21:27.26)
▶ Puck : Sleep... (0:21:38.75)
▶ Puck : Along with my daughter. (0:21:40.58)
▶ Kadomon Risch : Hey! (0:23:19.50)
▶ Kadomon Risch : You listening? (0:23:21.66)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : What? (0:23:22.66)
▶ Kadomon Risch : Don't "what" me! (0:23:23.71)
▶ Kadomon Risch : What's wrong with you?
You suddenly spaced out. (0:23:24.88)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : Oh... (0:23:28.16)
▶ Rem : Subaru-kun? (0:23:29.32)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : Rem... (0:23:32.16)
▶ Rem : Yes? (0:23:33.67)
▶ Rem : What's the matter? (0:23:35.16)
▶ Rem : You look like you've seen a ghost. (0:23:36.56)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : Rem... (0:23:40.29)
▶ Rem : Y-Yes? (0:23:41.40)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : Rem... (0:23:44.07)
▶ Rem : Yes? (0:23:45.02)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : I... (0:23:47.27)
▶ Kadomon Risch : Look! (0:23:48.07)
▶ Kadomon Risch : I hate to interrupt when you're
just getting heated up, (0:23:48.94)
▶ Kadomon Risch : but I can't run my business with
you two flirting there! (0:23:51.42)
▶ Rem : Subaru-kun, can I ask something? (0:23:56.25)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : What is it? (0:23:58.59)
▶ Rem : Well, I may be mistaken. (0:23:59.78)
▶ Rem : It's just that, well... (0:24:03.19)
▶ Rem : The unpleasant smell on you seems
to have grown stronger. (0:24:04.53)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : Unpleasant smell, huh? (0:24:10.91)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : Then, if you're worried, keep hold of my hand. (0:24:13.84)
▶ Rem : Huh? (0:24:17.30)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : This feels a lot safer, right? (0:24:18.70)
▶ Rem : Yes. (0:24:22.15)▶ Russell Fellow : If Crusch-sama's goal should be attained, (0:00:18.09)
▶ Russell Fellow : I'm sure it would suit your
desires, Wilhelm-dono. (0:00:21.37)
▶ Russell Fellow : I expect the best. (0:00:24.17)
▶ Russell Fellow : My, how unusual it is to see you! (0:00:26.25)
▶ Russell Fellow : My apologies. (0:00:31.25)
▶ Russell Fellow : I am the treasurer of the
capital's merchant guild. (0:00:33.23)
▶ Russell Fellow : My name is Russell Fellow. (0:00:37.39)
▶ Russell Fellow : It's a pleasure to meet you, (0:00:39.66)
▶ Russell Fellow : Natsuki Subaru-dono. (0:00:43.08)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : Wilhelm-san, who was that? (0:00:48.22)
▶ Wilhelm van Astrea : Russell Fellow. (0:00:50.53)
▶ Wilhelm van Astrea : Despite what he said, (0:00:52.43)
▶ Wilhelm van Astrea : he is shrewd, dealing in all of the capital's
inner and outer financial matters. (0:00:54.06)
▶ Wilhelm van Astrea : Now, I was just about to head back inside... (0:00:58.80)
▶ Wilhelm van Astrea : Do you have something to say? (0:01:05.34)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : People calling themselves (0:01:13.39)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : the Witch's Cult plan to attack
Roswaal's domain in three days. (0:01:14.45)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : I want to ask for your help in stopping them. (0:01:18.21)
▶ Crusch Karsten : I see. (0:01:21.80)
▶ Crusch Karsten : So they have made their move. (0:01:22.94)
▶ Felix Argyle : It seems so. (0:01:24.70)
▶ Felix Argyle : Of course, from the moment that Emilia-sama,
a half-elf, entered the scene, (0:01:25.91)
▶ Felix Argyle : we foresaw something like this happening. (0:01:29.80)
▶ Crusch Karsten : I understand the situation. (0:01:33.20)
▶ Crusch Karsten : My next question is how you
chose me to assist you. (0:01:35.04)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : Because, to be honest, you seem
the most likely to help right now. (0:01:37.95)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : You've helped Rem and me— (0:01:42.24)
▶ Crusch Karsten : Don't misunderstand. (0:01:44.06)
▶ Crusch Karsten : I helped you two because I
was contracted to do so. (0:01:45.28)
▶ Crusch Karsten : If you wish to negotiate, you need
to show me what I stand to gain. (0:01:48.91)
▶ Crusch Karsten : Otherwise, there is nothing to negotiate. (0:01:52.25)
▶ Crusch Karsten : If, with my assistance, (0:01:55.17)
▶ Crusch Karsten : you can eliminate the threat
posed by the Witch's Cult, (0:01:57.21)
▶ Crusch Karsten : what would my profit be? (0:02:00.10)
▶ Crusch Karsten : Tell me that. (0:02:01.77)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : If you help me out with this problem, (0:02:04.20)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : I'll owe a huge debt to your camp. (0:02:07.24)
▶ Crusch Karsten : Should I accept the proposal, (0:02:10.99)
▶ Crusch Karsten : it would mean Emilia's withdrawal
from the royal selection. (0:02:13.34)
▶ Crusch Karsten : You understand that? (0:02:17.00)
▶ Crusch Karsten : What did you expect? (0:02:19.83)
▶ Crusch Karsten : To place your own domain's survival
in the hands of another lord calls (0:02:21.08)
▶ Crusch Karsten : into question your ability to rule the nation. (0:02:24.51)
▶ Crusch Karsten : With that in mind, I ask you again... (0:02:27.19)
▶ Crusch Karsten : If you incur a debt to me through this deal, (0:02:29.37)
▶ Crusch Karsten : it will mean the elimination of
Emilia's camp from the race. (0:02:31.95)
▶ Crusch Karsten : Are you sure you want that? (0:02:34.92)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : Even still... (0:02:38.46)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : I want your help. (0:02:39.79)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : If she dies, everything ends, anyway. (0:02:42.00)
▶ Crusch Karsten : Understood. (0:02:46.49)
▶ Crusch Karsten : In that case, the Karsten family will
render no assistance whatsoever. (0:02:47.80)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : Huh? (0:02:52.33)
▶ Crusch Karsten : First of all, the condition
of Emilia's withdrawal, (0:02:54.08)
▶ Crusch Karsten : which you offered in desperation
as an advantage to me... (0:02:57.83)
▶ Crusch Karsten : It carries no weight in this negotiation. (0:03:02.35)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : But why? (0:03:05.19)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : Isn't removing one of your rivals
enough compensation?! (0:03:06.33)
▶ Crusch Karsten : Are you really not aware? (0:03:09.50)
▶ Crusch Karsten : Emilia's elimination from the royal selection (0:03:11.57)
▶ Crusch Karsten : will happen with or without my involvement. (0:03:13.71)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : Then you'll let the Witch's Cult slaughter (0:03:17.25)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : all of those villagers in Roswaal's domain?! (0:03:20.01)
▶ Crusch Karsten : Do not change the subject, Natsuki Subaru. (0:03:22.48)
▶ Crusch Karsten : It is Emilia who lacks the
power to protect that domain. (0:03:24.96)
▶ Crusch Karsten : And Emilia whose people will
die for her incompetence. (0:03:27.57)
▶ Crusch Karsten : It is not I. (0:03:30.30)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : B-But isn't knowing people will die
and not stopping it wrong? (0:03:31.84)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : If you have the power to save
them, why wouldn't you?! (0:03:35.13)
▶ Felix Argyle : Hey, I've heard enough— (0:03:38.01)
▶ Crusch Karsten : It's fine. (0:03:39.34)
▶ Crusch Karsten : Allow me to correct one idea you have. (0:03:40.80)
▶ Crusch Karsten : Say the Witch's Cult does make a move. (0:03:43.32)
▶ Crusch Karsten : That what you say comes to pass. (0:03:45.53)
▶ Crusch Karsten : However, the problem comes afterward. (0:03:47.61)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : Afterward? (0:03:49.63)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : It's simple. (0:03:51.40)
▶ Crusch Karsten : How do you know when or
where they will attack? (0:03:53.07)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : Th-That's... (0:03:57.32)
▶ Crusch Karsten : If you are a member of the Witch's Cult, (0:04:00.54)
▶ Crusch Karsten : it would make sense. (0:04:03.00)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : That's bull— (0:04:04.17)
▶ Rem : Crusch-sama, please do not make jokes. (0:04:04.75)
▶ Rem : Of course Subaru-kun isn't
a Witch's Cult member. (0:04:07.66)
▶ Crusch Karsten : Really? (0:04:10.20)
▶ Crusch Karsten : Given what he says, (0:04:11.29)
▶ Crusch Karsten : if he cannot explain
how he knows these details, (0:04:13.20)
▶ Crusch Karsten : I can draw no other conclusion. (0:04:15.71)
▶ Crusch Karsten : Have you never sensed any
such inclination in him? (0:04:18.25)
▶ Rem : Never. (0:04:22.60)
▶ Crusch Karsten : Regardless, I cannot lend
assistance to Emilia— (0:04:25.00)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : The Witch's Cult is coming! (0:04:30.55)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : They'll slaughter everyone in the village... (0:04:33.54)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : Kill them. (0:04:37.90)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : We just have to kill them! (0:04:38.99)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : All we have to do is kill every
single bastard in that cult! (0:04:40.46)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : That will solve everything! Everything! (0:04:45.21)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : You get that, right? (0:04:48.59)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : We can't let those bastards live! (0:04:49.63)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : I'm going to kill them! (0:04:52.01)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : Please help me! (0:04:54.50)
▶ Crusch Karsten : Is this why you behave as you do? (0:05:00.02)
▶ Crusch Karsten : Your hatred for the Witch's Cult... (0:05:05.06)
▶ Crusch Karsten : Is that your real reason
for approaching Emilia? (0:05:06.73)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : No, I— (0:05:10.39)
▶ Crusch Karsten : What else but murderous intent could
one call that glint in your eye? (0:05:12.17)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : You're suggesting I'm using Emilia as a
pretense for revenge against them?! (0:05:18.94)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : My hatred has nothing to do
with how evil they are! (0:05:23.67)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : They can't be allowed to live... (0:05:26.57)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : That's why we have to kill every one of them! (0:05:28.43)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : That will save everyone! (0:05:30.96)
▶ Crusch Karsten : I am certain I have told you, Natsuki Subaru. (0:05:36.73)
▶ Crusch Karsten : That if your own lie doesn't fool you,
it will not deceive others. (0:05:39.39)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : Why... (0:05:42.75)
▶ Crusch Karsten : You don't know why? (0:05:44.62)
▶ Crusch Karsten : You haven't once said (0:05:45.74)
▶ Crusch Karsten : that you want to save Emilia. (0:05:47.67)
▶ Wilhelm van Astrea : I cannot allow you to come any closer. (0:05:59.81)
▶ Rem : Subaru-kun, (0:06:04.54)
▶ Rem : please calm down. (0:06:06.21)
▶ Crusch Karsten : I can generally tell when the person
with whom I speak is lying. (0:06:10.20)
▶ Crusch Karsten : I am quite proud of the fact that I have
never been deceived in negotiations. (0:06:16.72)
▶ Crusch Karsten : Speaking from those years of experience, (0:06:21.79)
▶ Crusch Karsten : I can say you are not lying. (0:06:24.13)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : W-Well, then... (0:06:26.00)
▶ Crusch Karsten : You adamantly believe that your rant is true. (0:06:27.45)
▶ Crusch Karsten : That is nothing short of madness, (0:06:30.64)
▶ Crusch Karsten : Natsuki Subaru. (0:06:35.21)
▶ Crusch Karsten : Felis, heal his lip. (0:06:40.77)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : Don't bother! (0:06:42.54)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : Rem, let's go. (0:06:45.23)
▶ Crusch Karsten : Do you have anywhere else to turn? (0:06:47.40)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : I hope you become a great ruler... (0:06:49.63)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : The kind of dictator who abandons the weak. (0:06:52.07)
▶ Rem : In my master's stead, I thank you (0:06:59.88)
▶ Rem : for the care you have given us. (0:07:03.12)
▶ Rem : What will we do? (0:07:07.23)
▶ Rem : If what you say is true, we have little time. (0:07:08.51)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : "If" it's true? (0:07:12.08)
▶ Rem : We have little time. (0:07:14.24)
▶ Rem : Shall we return to Roswaal-sama's mansion? (0:07:16.27)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : No, there's not much the two of
us could do by going back now. (0:07:18.62)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : There aren't enough of us. (0:07:22.98)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : What the hell is Roswaal doing? (0:07:25.17)
▶ Rem : Roswaal-sama has been required to visit
some officials within the domain. (0:07:27.60)
▶ Rem : He will stay with them for a few days. (0:07:32.62)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : That's why he can't do
anything about the attack? (0:07:34.97)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : Then, unless we find reinforcements,
we won't get anywhere. (0:07:37.84)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : What about Reinhard? (0:07:44.16)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : Wouldn't he help us? (0:07:45.39)
▶ Rem : Yesterday, he said that he would be (0:07:46.94)
▶ Rem : away from the capital for a
while on a courtesy call. (0:07:48.99)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : Damn it! (0:07:51.74)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : Why are you all so useless?! (0:07:52.72)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : Tomorrow, we'll have to look
for someone else to help us. (0:08:00.71)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : You head to the knights' station. (0:08:03.67)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : I'm going to talk to one of
the other candidates. (0:08:06.00)
▶ Rem : Very well. (0:08:08.81)
▶ Priscilla Barielle : The Witch's Cult? (0:08:11.42)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : Yes. (0:08:13.44)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : If left alone, they'll hurt lots of people. (0:08:14.67)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : Emilia won't be their only victim. (0:08:17.49)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : I want to defeat them before that happens! (0:08:19.93)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : That's why I— (0:08:21.97)
▶ Priscilla Barielle : Amusing... You are amusing! (0:08:25.06)
▶ Priscilla Barielle : Indeed. (0:08:28.13)
▶ Priscilla Barielle : Any jester who makes it this
far has mastered his act... (0:08:29.16)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : Wh-What's so funny about this? (0:08:32.87)
▶ Priscilla Barielle : I can appreciate your desperation, (0:08:35.11)
▶ Priscilla Barielle : but you haven't thought things through. (0:08:37.45)
▶ Priscilla Barielle : In trying to aid your ally, you corner them,
benefit the enemy, and lose all control. (0:08:40.19)
▶ Priscilla Barielle : You're better off dying. (0:08:45.60)
▶ Priscilla Barielle : In fact, I could just lop off your
head for you right now. (0:08:48.17)
▶ Priscilla Barielle : Still, even in the face
of such harsh treatment, (0:08:54.93)
▶ Priscilla Barielle : the devotion you show for your master
is commendable, if nothing else. (0:08:58.38)
▶ Priscilla Barielle : So... (0:09:03.72)
▶ Priscilla Barielle : I will give you an opportunity. (0:09:05.71)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : A-An opportunity? (0:09:07.47)
▶ Priscilla Barielle : Yes, an opportunity. (0:09:08.49)
▶ Priscilla Barielle : What you would call a "chance." (0:09:10.21)
▶ Priscilla Barielle : Lick it. (0:09:14.61)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : Huh? (0:09:15.58)
▶ Priscilla Barielle : Crawl on the floor, (0:09:16.54)
▶ Priscilla Barielle : savoring the shame and humiliation. (0:09:18.37)
▶ Priscilla Barielle : And like a wretched beast, (0:09:20.69)
▶ Priscilla Barielle : like a baby suckling on its mother's teat, (0:09:22.72)
▶ Priscilla Barielle : lick my foot. (0:09:25.36)
▶ Priscilla Barielle : If you can do that,
I'll consider your proposal. (0:09:27.83)
▶ Priscilla Barielle : If you don't want to, that's fine... (0:09:32.25)
▶ Priscilla Barielle : If you'd rather favor your minuscule pride (0:09:34.30)
▶ Priscilla Barielle : and abandon the mistress you wagged
your tail for to the wasteland, fine. (0:09:36.85)
▶ Priscilla Barielle : Either choice you make will entertain me. (0:09:41.36)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : F-Fine. (0:09:50.56)
▶ Priscilla Barielle : I guess you really are just
an insignificant man! (0:10:07.43)
▶ Priscilla Barielle : What you just displayed was neither
loyalty nor devotion. (0:10:14.91)
▶ Priscilla Barielle : It's something more filthy, like a dog's
dependence or a pig's greed, (0:10:18.47)
▶ Priscilla Barielle : you lazy pig who knows only how to want! (0:10:22.22)
▶ Priscilla Barielle : A pig's greed is the ugliest thing there is! (0:10:24.56)
▶ Priscilla Barielle : Even if the Witch's Cult is defeated, (0:10:28.39)
▶ Priscilla Barielle : I will strike down any camp you are part of! (0:10:30.99)
▶ Priscilla Barielle : Your careless behavior and attitude
have led me to that decision! (0:10:35.19)
▶ Priscilla Barielle : Aldebaran. (0:10:45.04)
▶ Aldebaran : Hey, now... What happened in here? (0:10:46.88)
▶ Priscilla Barielle : Throw that detestable fool out of here. (0:10:49.04)
▶ Priscilla Barielle : Or kill him if you want. It matters not. (0:10:51.67)
▶ Aldebaran : I think that matters quite a bit. (0:10:53.76)
▶ Aldebaran : Let's go, brother. (0:10:56.68)
▶ Aldebaran : Don't get so mad, Princess. (0:10:59.50)
▶ Aldebaran : That fierce look will make your
cute face drop in value. (0:11:01.57)
▶ Priscilla Barielle : Unless you want your
ruined face further ruined, (0:11:04.38)
▶ Priscilla Barielle : take him away at once, Aldebaran. (0:11:07.61)
▶ Aldebaran : I've told you not to call me that... (0:11:09.69)
▶ Aldebaran : Can you stand, brother? (0:11:13.52)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : Yeah. (0:11:15.07)
▶ Aldebaran : You seem okay. (0:11:16.87)
▶ Aldebaran : I don't know what you were discussing, (0:11:18.31)
▶ Aldebaran : but it looks like it didn't go very well. (0:11:21.27)
▶ Aldebaran : If I take too long, (0:11:26.94)
▶ Aldebaran : she might seriously tell
me to chop you in half, (0:11:28.36)
▶ Aldebaran : so I'm heading back. (0:11:31.88)
▶ Aldebaran : Later, brother. (0:11:33.08)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : That damn stuck-up bitch... (0:11:36.85)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : She's forgetting that I saved
her when we first met! (0:11:39.12)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : Change gears. (0:11:44.89)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : This is no time for those
idiots to bog me down. (0:11:46.18)
▶ Mimi Pearlbaton : Sniff, sniff. Sniff, sniff. (0:11:48.60)
▶ Mimi Pearlbaton : That looks super painful! Are you okee? (0:11:50.46)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : Huh? (0:11:54.46)
▶ Mimi Pearlbaton : You smell like blood,
and not just from your lip. (0:11:55.87)
▶ Mimi Pearlbaton : Was your nose bleedy? (0:11:59.00)
▶ Anastasia Hoshin : Now, Mimi, no getting into mischief. (0:12:01.26)
▶ Mimi Pearlbaton : 'Kay! (0:12:04.15)
▶ Anastasia Hoshin : I'm awful sorry she's been botherin' you. (0:12:05.08)
▶ Anastasia Hoshin : Hmm? Aren't you... (0:12:08.82)
▶ Anastasia Hoshin : Right, you're Natsuki-kun. (0:12:11.43)
▶ Anastasia Hoshin : Emilia's knight, Natsuki Subaru-kun. (0:12:13.57)
▶ Anastasia Hoshin : Ain't this a coincidence? (0:12:16.59)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : Anastasia Hoshin... (0:12:19.24)
▶ Mimi Pearlbaton : Let's eat! (0:12:24.95)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : So, about the dragon-drawn carriage... (0:12:28.01)
▶ Anastasia Hoshin : You don't beat around the bush. (0:12:30.25)
▶ Anastasia Hoshin : You won't make anyone happy
by prioritizin' your own goals. (0:12:32.83)
▶ Anastasia Hoshin : Trying to get on the other's good side
is the basic rule of negotiation. (0:12:36.54)
▶ Anastasia Hoshin : That's where you're lackin', Natsuki-kun. (0:12:40.61)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : Sorry, but I've got a real problem here. (0:12:42.60)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : I want to leave the capital tomorrow, so... (0:12:45.31)
▶ Anastasia Hoshin : When you're up against my kind, (0:12:48.00)
▶ Anastasia Hoshin : tryin' to appeal to sentimentality
is the worst strategy there is. (0:12:49.74)
▶ Anastasia Hoshin : But I applaud your effort. (0:12:54.00)
▶ Anastasia Hoshin : It's no easy task to find a dragon-drawn
carriage in the capital right now. (0:12:57.69)
▶ Anastasia Hoshin : Apparently, someone's buyin' up all of 'em. (0:13:02.28)
▶ Anastasia Hoshin : Here. The place at this address
should have a carriage left. (0:13:05.29)
▶ Anastasia Hoshin : I've signed it with my own name. (0:13:08.74)
▶ Anastasia Hoshin : This'll square everything away. (0:13:11.20)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : Don't put on airs... (0:13:15.76)
▶ Anastasia Hoshin : I surely will put on airs. (0:13:17.35)
▶ Anastasia Hoshin : It's no fun if I just hand
it to ya normally, right? (0:13:19.21)
▶ Anastasia Hoshin : I just wanted to chat with
ya about this an' that. (0:13:22.27)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : Why bother with that?
You don't gain anything from it. (0:13:25.59)
▶ Anastasia Hoshin : I believe there's nothin' in this
world that has no meaning. (0:13:28.97)
▶ Anastasia Hoshin : You never know who might
give ya some inspiration. (0:13:33.90)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : What do we talk about? (0:13:38.68)
▶ Mimi Pearlbaton : Hey, my lady, (0:13:40.88)
▶ Mimi Pearlbaton : I wanna eat some more! (0:13:42.46)
▶ Mimi Pearlbaton : Can I order? (0:13:44.03)
▶ Anastasia Hoshin : Sure. Eat all ya like. (0:13:45.20)
▶ Anastasia Hoshin : Oh, but don't get your mouth
all messy with sauce. (0:13:47.37)
▶ Mimi Pearlbaton : Wipe my face, please! (0:13:49.95)
▶ Mimi Pearlbaton : Yay! I'll be back! (0:13:53.99)
▶ Anastasia Hoshin : Despite her looks, (0:13:57.18)
▶ Anastasia Hoshin : she's second-in-command in my private army. (0:13:58.75)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : Private army? (0:14:01.35)
▶ Mimi Pearlbaton : Um, um, I want this, too!
And also, um, um... (0:14:02.56)
▶ Anastasia Hoshin : It's quite famous in Kararagi. (0:14:02.88)
▶ Anastasia Hoshin : The Hoshin Company's personal
mercenary squad, Iron Fang. (0:14:05.15)
▶ Anastasia Hoshin : Ain't she super cute? (0:14:09.68)
▶ Anastasia Hoshin : Nothing beats sleepin' with her in your arms! (0:14:11.73)
▶ Anastasia Hoshin : Lately, lots of people have been
gatherin' in the capital. (0:14:16.28)
▶ Anastasia Hoshin : Have you noticed the atmosphere's
different now, Natsuki-kun? (0:14:20.00)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : Now that you mention it, everyone did
seem to be in a frenzy. (0:14:24.35)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : Because of the royal selection? (0:14:27.95)
▶ Anastasia Hoshin : When those on top move, the people move. (0:14:29.43)
▶ Anastasia Hoshin : When the people move, things move. (0:14:31.82)
▶ Anastasia Hoshin : By the way, the value of things in the
capital is fluctuatin' a lot now. (0:14:34.28)
▶ Anastasia Hoshin : Some of the most valuable
products are iron goods. (0:14:38.90)
▶ Anastasia Hoshin : Weapons, like swords and spears, are bein'
gathered from both inside and outside. (0:14:41.85)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : Iron and weapons? (0:14:46.09)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : They're not planning to go to war
with those things, are they? (0:14:47.96)
▶ Anastasia Hoshin : It's also possible their objective
isn't to acquire the items, (0:14:51.57)
▶ Anastasia Hoshin : but gettin' the economy rolling. (0:14:55.01)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : The way you said that... (0:14:57.10)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : Is it well known who's
gathering all this iron? (0:14:58.67)
▶ Anastasia Hoshin : It's someone you know well, Natsuki-kun. (0:15:01.85)
▶ Anastasia Hoshin : Duchess Crusch Karsten. (0:15:05.63)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : It's Crusch? (0:15:08.32)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : Come to think of it, she did have
a constant stream of visitors... (0:15:09.84)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : I get it. (0:15:14.19)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : That's why that Russell guy was there. (0:15:15.74)
▶ Anastasia Hoshin : Russell Fellow? (0:15:18.92)
▶ Anastasia Hoshin : He's quite a big fish. (0:15:20.97)
▶ Anastasia Hoshin : This has been fairly informative. (0:15:23.22)
▶ Anastasia Hoshin : Thank you, Natsuki-kun! (0:15:26.23)
▶ Anastasia Hoshin : After fightin' with Crusch-san last night,
you just left her place, right? (0:15:29.50)
▶ Anastasia Hoshin : I figured it'd be easy to learn (0:15:33.42)
▶ Anastasia Hoshin : all sorts of information from your
mouth, eyes, and expressions! (0:15:35.76)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : You set me up from the start? (0:15:44.19)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : Are you happy with yourself, (0:15:48.00)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : using underhanded methods like that? (0:15:50.80)
▶ Anastasia Hoshin : If ya want to convince
someone you're righteous, (0:15:54.15)
▶ Anastasia Hoshin : you've gotta show somethin' to merit it. (0:15:56.77)
▶ Anastasia Hoshin : And I see no such thing in you. (0:15:59.07)
▶ Anastasia Hoshin : The only way to change your reputation
is to replace it with another. (0:16:02.04)
▶ Anastasia Hoshin : The things you've done are what
determine your reputation. (0:16:06.44)
▶ Anastasia Hoshin : That is, your past. (0:16:09.26)
▶ Anastasia Hoshin : And there's no way to change your past, (0:16:10.78)
▶ Anastasia Hoshin : so my opinion of ya isn't
gonna change, either. (0:16:13.11)
▶ Anastasia Hoshin : The things you've done won't ever go away. (0:16:16.71)
▶ Mimi Pearlbaton : You don't wanna get any closer to my lady. (0:16:22.94)
▶ Mimi Pearlbaton : I'm super strong, you know. (0:16:26.81)
▶ Anastasia Hoshin : Thanks, Mimi... (0:16:28.52)
▶ Anastasia Hoshin : But you don't have to do anything. (0:16:30.84)
▶ Anastasia Hoshin : There's nothin' Natsuki-kun can do, anyway. (0:16:32.80)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : Both of you are absolute scum! (0:16:35.93)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : Screw you both! (0:16:38.65)
▶ Anastasia Hoshin : I guess Julius's efforts went to waste... (0:16:41.72)
▶ Anastasia Hoshin : It's partly my fault, though. (0:16:44.43)
▶ Anastasia Hoshin : I guess not even you would
do something that dumb. (0:16:48.01)
▶ Anastasia Hoshin : I'm relieved. (0:16:51.17)
▶ Anastasia Hoshin : Mimi, let's go. (0:16:52.81)
▶ Mimi Pearlbaton : 'Kay! (0:16:54.16)
▶ Anastasia Hoshin : One last thing. (0:16:58.20)
▶ Anastasia Hoshin : The key to negotiation is how prepared
you are before ya come to the table. (0:17:00.91)
▶ Anastasia Hoshin : Know what the other person wants,
and dangle it in front of 'em. (0:17:06.45)
▶ Anastasia Hoshin : And since all you do is want,
that's where you're lacking. (0:17:10.11)
▶ Anastasia Hoshin : Now, shall we go, everyone? (0:17:14.80)
▶ Mimi Pearlbaton : See ya later! (0:17:26.78)
▶ Mimi Pearlbaton : Bye-bye! (0:17:33.38)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : Damn it! (0:17:38.17)
▶ Rem : Subaru-kun, what's wrong? (0:17:43.96)
▶ Rem : Did something happen? (0:17:46.25)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : Nothing! (0:17:46.68)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : Rem, how did it go? (0:17:48.30)
▶ Rem : I reported the maneuvers by the
Witch's Cult to the knights' station. (0:17:51.60)
▶ Rem : I gave them Roswaal-sama's name, but... (0:17:56.30)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : Not the response we wanted? (0:17:59.20)
▶ Rem : It seems the knights have received
several such reports already. (0:18:02.64)
▶ Rem : Since the Cult's background is unclear, (0:18:06.95)
▶ Rem : they said they receive countless
unverifiable, anonymous tips. (0:18:09.26)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : If that's how the real cultists stay hidden, (0:18:12.73)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : it's no laughing matter. (0:18:15.59)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : If we can't scrape a
military force together... (0:18:17.12)
▶ Rem : What shall we do? (0:18:21.73)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : We'll go back to the mansion... (0:18:26.87)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : Go back and take Emilia and
Ram away from there. (0:18:28.89)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : To the capital or to Roswaal...
Anywhere is fine. (0:18:32.19)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : Where they are now is dangerous! (0:18:35.60)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : There's no time. (0:18:37.80)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : We should leave now. (0:18:38.79)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : At this pace, we should reach
the mansion by morning. (0:18:43.60)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : Then we'll have plenty of time to take
Emilia and run from the Witch's Cult. (0:18:46.43)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : The question is how to transport her... (0:18:51.29)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : That's... (0:18:58.38)
▶ Otto Suwen : From here to the Mathers domain? (0:19:01.10)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : Yeah. (0:19:03.00)
▶ Otto Suwen : It's already late. Isn't it too dangerous? (0:19:04.22)
▶ Otto Suwen : We were planning to camp here tonight. (0:19:06.54)
▶ Otto Suwen : Would you care to join us? (0:19:09.36)
▶ EXTRA : You say that, Otto... (0:19:11.08)
▶ EXTRA : But I bet you just wanna get rid of some (0:19:13.29)
▶ EXTRA : of the oil in storage that you
bought out of season, right? (0:19:15.71)
▶ Otto Suwen : That's not my intention at all! (0:19:19.63)
▶ Otto Suwen : Though, it isn't as if I weren't hoping
you could use a little oil... (0:19:22.07)
▶ Rem : What's this about oil? (0:19:28.05)
▶ Otto Suwen : Oh, I just made a bit of a mistake. (0:19:30.01)
▶ Otto Suwen : And now, I have a lot of oil that
isn't worth much right now. (0:19:33.10)
▶ Otto Suwen : Even if we go to the capital, I don't
know if I can sell it all off... (0:19:39.49)
▶ Otto Suwen : And if I can't, I'm ruined! (0:19:44.03)
▶ Otto Suwen : Ruined... (0:19:47.34)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : Otto, I need to talk— (0:19:50.09)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : I mean, ask for your help. (0:19:51.91)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : I'll buy all the oil in your carriage. (0:19:54.74)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : So in return, lend us transport. (0:19:58.58)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : All of the merchants and carriages here... (0:20:01.01)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : Anyone who'll sell transportation
for money, sell it to me! (0:20:03.21)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : We're transporting people! (0:20:06.88)
▶ Otto Suwen : People?! We don't want any
part in human trafficking! (0:20:08.00)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : I'm not running that kind of side business... (0:20:11.00)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : There's a village near the Mathers mansion. (0:20:13.90)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : I want you to take its
residents somewhere else! (0:20:16.58)
▶ Rem : We will, of course, thank you properly. (0:20:24.62)
▶ Otto Suwen : If we run through the night, (0:20:30.48)
▶ Otto Suwen : we should enter the Mathers
domain by morning. (0:20:32.75)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : Sorry we can't take breaks. (0:20:36.35)
▶ Otto Suwen : No problem! (0:20:37.90)
▶ Otto Suwen : Getting rid of my excess stock and
even earning transport fees... (0:20:38.90)
▶ Otto Suwen : I feel invincible! (0:20:42.28)
▶ Rem : Subaru-kun, I'm sorry. (0:20:43.69)
▶ Rem : I would like to check the map to
confirm the remaining distance. (0:20:45.28)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : Map? (0:20:48.88)
▶ Rem : It is in your bag. (0:20:49.84)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : Oh, this? (0:20:53.72)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : It's too dark to see anything, though... (0:20:55.47)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : Ah, I know. (0:20:58.55)
▶ Rem : Subaru-kun, what is that? (0:21:05.34)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : A bit of lost technology. (0:21:07.21)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : I mean, it's future technology
called a cell phone. (0:21:09.26)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : I guess it's a good thing it has
some battery left, barely. (0:21:12.12)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : Here, look. (0:21:15.68)
▶ Otto Suwen : Natsuki-san, what is that? (0:21:17.28)
▶ EXTRA : Never seen a crystalight like that before. (0:21:20.14)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : It's a secret tool the margrave gave me. (0:21:22.39)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : Sorry, but you should probably
forget you saw it... (0:21:25.52)
▶ Otto Suwen : Whoa, why does that sound like dark dealings
that reek of nothing but money? (0:21:28.24)
▶ Rem : Just a bit farther, (0:21:32.20)
▶ Rem : and we should see Flügel's Tree. (0:21:33.75)
▶ Rem : If we head northeast from there,
the Mathers domain isn't far. (0:21:36.24)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : Flügel's Tree? (0:21:39.87)
▶ Otto Suwen : A huge tree that stands so tall in the Lifaus
Highway, it seems to pierce the clouds. (0:21:41.55)
▶ EXTRA : Legend has it that, centuries ago,
a wise man named Flügel planted it. (0:21:46.22)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : I see... (0:21:52.75)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : I can't call that anything but amazing. (0:21:54.50)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : Where'd the guy in the bandana go? (0:22:00.74)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : He didn't get distracted by the tree
and run off course, did he? (0:22:04.68)
▶ Otto Suwen : What's wrong, Natsuki-san? (0:22:08.58)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : Where'd that buddy of yours go? (0:22:10.30)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : The older guy in the bandana, (0:22:12.68)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : riding on this side of us? (0:22:14.37)
▶ Otto Suwen : What are you talking about? (0:22:19.21)
▶ Otto Suwen : No one was riding on the
opposite side from me. (0:22:20.96)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : Huh? (0:22:24.51)▶ Rem : Subaru-kun! (0:00:15.78)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : Wh-What happened? What the
hell is going on?! (0:00:35.27)
▶ Rem : Subaru-kun, stay down. (0:00:39.45)
▶ Rem : We've lost our Windbreak protection! (0:00:41.14)
▶ Otto Suwen : You didn't know? (0:00:42.83)
▶ Otto Suwen : Only one being with such a huge
body can fly through fog! (0:00:44.30)
▶ Otto Suwen : The White Whale! (0:00:49.92)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : Rem, do you see the White Whale? (0:02:30.06)
▶ Rem : I cannot! It's too dark! (0:02:32.36)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : What happened to the other carriages? (0:02:34.30)
▶ Rem : They seem to have scattered. (0:02:36.49)
▶ Rem : But I do not know where they have fled! (0:02:38.22)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : Damn it! (0:02:40.46)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : After we finally found some transportation... (0:02:41.45)
▶ Rem : Run past it, to the left! (0:03:01.07)
▶ Otto Suwen : Left, left, left, left, left, left, left! (0:03:03.49)
▶ Rem : Eat this! (0:03:14.76)
▶ Otto Suwen : D-Did you get it? (0:03:22.98)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : It didn't work. (0:03:29.68)
▶ Otto Suwen : Wh-Why is it targeting us? (0:03:30.59)
▶ Otto Suwen : There are other carriages out there! (0:03:33.16)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : Complaining won't change anything! (0:03:35.76)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : Think... Think, think! (0:03:39.64)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : We need a way out! (0:03:42.39)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : Isn't there something?
Anything, anything, anything?! (0:03:43.60)
▶ Rem : Subaru-kun... (0:03:47.63)
▶ Rem : Please accept this. (0:03:49.88)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : Did you come up with something? (0:03:51.81)
▶ Rem : I shall get off the carriage and intercept it. (0:03:54.12)
▶ Rem : In the meantime, you escape the fog. (0:03:56.61)
▶ Rem : Otto-sama, please take care of Subaru-kun. (0:04:00.24)
▶ Rem : He has the payment we promised you. (0:04:03.43)
▶ Otto Suwen : P-Payment? (0:04:05.54)
▶ Otto Suwen : That's the least of our problems now! (0:04:07.28)
▶ Otto Suwen : We have to stay alive first! (0:04:08.70)
▶ Rem : Subaru-kun, I am not very smart, (0:04:11.08)
▶ Rem : so this is the only plan I can think of. (0:04:13.72)
▶ Rem : Please... (0:04:15.92)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : H-Hold on, Rem! (0:04:16.79)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : I won't let you! I won't let you go! (0:04:18.70)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : If... If you also die, I'll... (0:04:20.86)
▶ Rem : I believe I was born for this very moment. (0:04:32.09)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : What are you talk— (0:04:38.94)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : What did you... (0:04:42.92)
▶ Rem : It will be all right. (0:04:46.06)
▶ Rem : I shall be watching over
you from behind, always. (0:04:47.49)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : Where's Rem? (0:05:17.42)
▶ Otto Suwen : Natsuki-san, you're awake? (0:05:18.65)
▶ Otto Suwen : Please don't move. (0:05:20.93)
▶ Otto Suwen : The ground dragon's still
running at full speed! (0:05:22.43)
▶ Otto Suwen : I don't have time to worry about you! (0:05:24.54)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : I don't care about that! (0:05:27.12)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : Where's Rem? What happened to Rem? (0:05:29.05)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : Answer me, Otto! What happened to Rem?! (0:05:31.63)
▶ Otto Suwen : So we could escape, (0:05:37.45)
▶ Otto Suwen : she jumped out of the carriage
to intercept the White Whale. (0:05:40.08)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : Go back. (0:05:49.32)
▶ Otto Suwen : Huh?! (0:05:50.26)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : I said to go back! We have to... (0:05:51.72)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : We have to save Rem! (0:05:54.56)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : Go back right now! (0:05:56.19)
▶ Otto Suwen : Wh-What good will that do? (0:05:59.22)
▶ Otto Suwen : Didn't you see how terrifying that
monster, the White Whale, is? (0:06:01.57)
▶ Otto Suwen : That would be suicide! (0:06:05.33)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : I saw the monster up close! (0:06:06.64)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : That's why I'm telling you to go back! (0:06:09.01)
▶ Otto Suwen : Have you gone insane?! (0:06:11.67)
▶ Otto Suwen : You want to squander
the hope that she left us? (0:06:14.28)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : Don't you dare talk about Rem! (0:06:18.55)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : You abandoned her... (0:06:20.70)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : You have no right to talk about her! (0:06:22.20)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : Go back! (0:06:24.44)
▶ Otto Suwen : You still don't understand how
terrifying the White Whale is?! (0:06:24.95)
▶ Otto Suwen : When a punitive force, assembled by
Lugunica, set out to subjugate it, (0:06:28.24)
▶ Otto Suwen : that monster killed
the first Master Swordsman! (0:06:32.14)
▶ Otto Suwen : There's no way we can win! (0:06:35.30)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : It killed... the Master Swordsman? (0:06:37.61)
▶ Otto Suwen : I'm weak, and you are, too. (0:06:41.72)
▶ Otto Suwen : So there's no way we can save that girl. (0:06:44.38)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : But I know Rem isn't actually strong, either. (0:06:49.90)
▶ Otto Suwen : For now, we were fortunate to escape it. (0:06:55.64)
▶ Otto Suwen : But in this mist, there's no telling
when it'll show up again. (0:06:58.44)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : Otto, watch what you say! (0:07:02.81)
▶ Otto Suwen : Eh? What do you mean, Natsuki-san? (0:07:05.59)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : Don't talk like this is some game! (0:07:07.29)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : We were "fortunate"?! (0:07:09.53)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : You must be joking... (0:07:11.28)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : Do you know how Rem felt when she— (0:07:12.84)
▶ Otto Suwen : Who is Rem? (0:07:15.66)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : Huh? (0:07:17.75)
▶ Otto Suwen : There wasn't anyone with that name (0:07:19.73)
▶ Otto Suwen : among the merchants who broke off from us. (0:07:22.50)
▶ Otto Suwen : Who are you talking about? (0:07:25.25)
▶ Otto Suwen : What do you think you're doing?! (0:07:33.96)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : Cut the crap... (0:07:35.89)

▶ Subaru Natsuki : Do you have a death wish?! (0:07:41.89)
▶ Otto Suwen : I'm telling you, I don't know
what you're talking about... (0:07:43.40)
▶ Otto Suwen : Why are you suddenly talking like this? (0:07:46.60)
▶ Otto Suwen : Did seeing the White Whale
make you lose your mind? (0:07:49.16)
▶ Otto Suwen : Why? Why? Why is it so persistent? (0:08:00.43)
▶ Otto Suwen : I thought we'd left it behind! (0:08:03.60)

▶ Subaru Natsuki : Rem... (0:08:15.05)
▶ Otto Suwen : Is... Is there some mark it's following?! (0:08:15.59)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : It can't be. (0:08:20.46)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : That monster, the White Whale... (0:08:22.11)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : It's a mabeast, too? (0:08:27.56)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : Then, it's being drawn to me? (0:08:30.57)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : No way. (0:08:34.82)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : Rem, I... No... (0:08:37.28)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : It's my fault! (0:08:41.44)
▶ Otto Suwen : Natsuki-san, please die. (0:08:44.85)

▶ Subaru Natsuki : Rem, forgive me. (0:10:20.02)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : You're... (0:10:29.32)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : Where is he? Where's Otto? (0:10:33.46)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : I see... (0:10:38.73)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : Let's go. (0:10:46.89)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : The forest? (0:11:08.26)
▶ EXTRA : Huh? Subaru? (0:11:13.17)
▶ EXTRA : It is Subaru! (0:11:19.46)
▶ EXTRA : What happened to you, Subaru? (0:11:21.59)
▶ EXTRA : You're a mess, Subaru. You stink! (0:11:25.19)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : You guys... (0:11:30.72)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : I wasn't too late this time? (0:11:33.88)
▶ EXTRA : Subaru? (0:11:39.96)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : Rem— (0:11:57.11)
▶ Ram : Why are you so eagerly touching me, Barusu? (0:12:00.97)
▶ Ram : I understand that, after a few days
away, you're happy to see me. (0:12:03.48)
▶ Ram : But don't instinctively jump on me like that. (0:12:06.48)
▶ Ram : It's indecent. (0:12:09.12)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : Oh... Yeah, that's right... (0:12:11.28)
▶ Ram : So, Barusu, tell me what happened. (0:12:14.20)
▶ Ram : You were in terrible shape. (0:12:18.15)
▶ Ram : Your dislocated shoulder, split forehead,
and broken ribs have been mended. (0:12:19.85)
▶ Ram : But if you move too much, they'll reopen (0:12:23.89)
▶ Ram : I've discarded your muddy,
blood-soaked clothes. (0:12:26.09)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : Oh, thanks. (0:12:28.60)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : The one who healed my wounds... (0:12:31.99)
▶ Ram : It was Emilia-sama. (0:12:34.72)
▶ Ram : She didn't tell me what happened
in the capital between you two. (0:12:39.86)
▶ Ram : I'm not interested. (0:12:44.64)
▶ Ram : Judging by her reaction, (0:12:46.37)
▶ Ram : I'm sure you did something you shouldn't have. (0:12:47.88)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : That's harsh. (0:12:50.39)
▶ Ram : I think it's an appropriate assessment. (0:12:51.86)
▶ Ram : Perfect for a loser, afraid to approach (0:12:54.07)
▶ Ram : the heart of the matter, who'd do
anything to put it off a little. (0:12:56.51)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : Rem is dead. (0:13:08.06)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : I... couldn't do anything. (0:13:10.80)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : The fog... the White Whale...
appeared on the road. (0:13:13.98)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : So, to cover my escape, Rem... (0:13:17.77)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : But... I was left alone in the fog. (0:13:21.44)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : And... (0:13:25.71)
▶ Ram : Barusu... (0:13:26.71)
▶ Ram : Rem... (0:13:29.55)
▶ Ram : Who is that? (0:13:32.01)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : Huh? (0:13:35.34)
▶ Ram : Who is Rem, Barusu? (0:13:36.76)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : Wh-What do you mean, "who"? (0:13:39.50)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : Don't be ridiculous... (0:13:41.36)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : Sh-She's your younger sister! (0:13:42.80)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : You know, Rem! Rem... Rem! (0:13:45.18)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : This is no time for— (0:13:47.45)
▶ Ram : I have no younger sister. (0:13:48.56)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : Don't say that! If not for Rem... (0:13:49.93)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : That's right! (0:13:52.88)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : What would you call that whole
mess in the mabeast forest?! (0:13:54.25)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : You, Rem, and I fought those mabeasts and— (0:13:57.10)
▶ Ram : Something is seriously wrong with you, Barusu. (0:13:59.54)
▶ Ram : I hate to admit it, (0:14:02.22)
▶ Ram : but you were half-responsible
for the ulgarm eradication. (0:14:03.70)
▶ Ram : Roswaal-sama and I handled the rest. (0:14:07.45)
▶ Ram : This long-lost sister you call
"Rem" has no place in it. (0:14:11.28)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : That's not funny. (0:14:16.98)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : Even for a nightmare, this doesn't make sense! (0:14:19.28)
▶ Ram : I am always serious. (0:14:21.83)
▶ Ram : You must be the one who's dreaming. (0:14:24.18)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : Dreaming... Dreaming? (0:14:26.47)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : Dreaming?! (0:14:29.81)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : That's bull! (0:14:31.57)
▶ Ram : Barusu, you shouldn't stand— (0:14:33.32)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : Shut up! Just... Just be quiet and watch! (0:14:34.78)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : It can't be... (0:14:46.08)
▶ Ram : Barusu, are you satisfied? (0:14:48.94)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : Rem isn't... (0:14:52.11)
▶ Ram : No such person has ever lived in this room. (0:14:54.59)
▶ Ram : Go back to your room and sleep. (0:15:03.28)
▶ Ram : Your exhaustion is making you confused. (0:15:06.60)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : All I have to do is run away,
run away, run away. (0:15:12.72)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : What good will running do? (0:15:19.29)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : Lend me your courage, Rem! (0:15:31.25)
▶ Emilia : Subaru? (0:15:42.02)
▶ Emilia : Why... (0:15:48.00)
▶ Emilia : did you come back? (0:15:49.97)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : Let's go. (0:15:54.57)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : We can't stay here! (0:15:55.80)
▶ Emilia : Go? Where? (0:15:57.64)
▶ Emilia : No... Why? (0:15:59.58)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : Anywhere that isn't here! (0:16:01.34)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : If you have to ask why,
I'd say, "For your sake." (0:16:03.78)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : I came back for you! (0:16:07.60)
▶ Emilia : That again, Subaru? (0:16:09.24)
▶ Emilia : You came back, covered in wounds,
and worried me to death. (0:16:11.41)
▶ Emilia : Weren't you in the capital
so Felis could treat you? (0:16:14.87)
▶ Emilia : Why are you here now? (0:16:18.02)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : If... (0:16:21.18)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : If you protest, I'll drag you away, if I must! (0:16:22.05)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : In a few days, you'll see I was right,
whether you want to or not! (0:16:24.66)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : So just... (0:16:28.16)
▶ Emilia : Wait! Wait, Subaru! (0:16:28.67)
▶ Emilia : What happened to you? (0:16:30.58)
▶ Emilia : You weren't this kind of person before. (0:16:31.72)
▶ Emilia : I thought you... And yet— (0:16:33.89)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : Just be quiet, and do as I say! (0:16:36.05)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : You can't stay here! (0:16:39.76)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : You'll regret it... You will! (0:16:41.71)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : No one will be saved. (0:16:44.10)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : I don't want to suffer and cry anymore! (0:16:45.42)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : Just do as I say! (0:16:48.56)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : Then everything will work out! It will! (0:16:51.05)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : Why doesn't anyone understand?! (0:16:54.46)
▶ Emilia : I'm sorry. (0:16:57.97)
▶ Emilia : I don't understand what you're saying... (0:16:59.23)
▶ Emilia : I want to. (0:17:03.69)
▶ Emilia : But right now, I'm not sure
I have time for that. (0:17:05.61)
▶ Emilia : There's so much I need to do. (0:17:10.33)
▶ Emilia : So for now... (0:17:13.43)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : It won't work. (0:17:15.51)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : It won't work. (0:17:18.72)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : You won't work. You'll fail! (0:17:20.20)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : You can't do it. It's no use. (0:17:22.36)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : You're all talk! You can't save
anyone, or be saved! (0:17:24.79)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : You'll keep acting rashly and unreasonably, (0:17:27.45)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : until you see as many corpses as the
number of your reckless decisions! (0:17:29.29)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : That is your future! (0:17:32.78)
▶ Emilia : Why? (0:17:35.56)
▶ Emilia : Why are you crying, as if you're in such pain? (0:17:37.78)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : After... After she sent me here... (0:17:45.13)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : No, after she brought me here, there's... (0:17:48.89)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : There's something I must do for Rem's sake... (0:17:52.56)
▶ Emilia : Rem? (0:17:55.95)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : You, too? (0:17:59.87)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : You've forgotten Rem, too? (0:18:02.46)
▶ Emilia : Subaru? (0:18:04.20)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : Fine, I'll tell you everything... (0:18:07.35)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : If you all are going to forget Rem, (0:18:10.09)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : I'd rather expose everything
and end up vomiting blood! (0:18:13.16)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : If you're coming for me, then come. (0:18:17.11)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : I'll gladly give you my beating heart! (0:18:19.12)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : Emilia... (0:18:24.06)
▶ Emilia : Yes? (0:18:26.22)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : I can use Return by Death to— (0:18:28.99)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : What was that about? (0:18:53.56)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : Usually... (0:18:55.20)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : Huh? (0:18:58.16)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : Emilia? (0:19:00.93)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : Don't... Wha— Huh? (0:19:07.46)
▶ Beatrice : You have the look of someone who believes
he's the world's most unfortunate soul. (0:19:35.79)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : Beatrice... (0:19:41.96)
▶ Beatrice : Bubby won't come out, I suppose. (0:19:44.95)
▶ Beatrice : Don't worry. Bubby won't die, I suppose. (0:19:53.65)
▶ Beatrice : He just returned to his
original form for now. (0:19:57.42)
▶ Beatrice : You have something you want to say, I suppose? (0:20:02.44)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : Please kill me. Right here. (0:20:08.92)
▶ Beatrice : You would ask me to kill you? (0:20:13.23)
▶ Beatrice : That's too cruel, I suppose. (0:20:15.92)
▶ Beatrice : You understand nothing. (0:20:19.40)
▶ Beatrice : You understand nothing at all. (0:20:21.50)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : Huh? Beatrice? (0:20:23.95)
▶ Beatrice : I won't grant any of your wishes, I suppose. (0:20:26.22)
▶ Beatrice : If you want to die, then die on your own. (0:20:30.22)
▶ Beatrice : Betty wants no part of it, I suppose. (0:20:33.87)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : What are you... (0:20:38.08)
▶ Beatrice : Everything is already hopeless, (0:20:39.31)
▶ Beatrice : but your staying here is a problem. (0:20:41.92)
▶ Beatrice : I will, at least,
protect the mansion, I suppose. (0:20:44.76)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : Beatrice? (0:20:51.41)
▶ Beatrice : Betty is not like Roswaal. (0:20:53.24)
▶ Beatrice : Even if it would secure a future for me, (0:20:55.87)
▶ Beatrice : I've had enough of pain, suffering, fear... (0:20:58.16)
▶ Beatrice : Everything, I suppose! (0:21:00.92)
▶ Beatrice : At least die where I can't see you, I suppose. (0:21:09.71)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : Emilia... (0:21:25.92)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : Sorry... I'm sorry. (0:21:32.79)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : I'm sorry. (0:21:35.42)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : I'm so sorry... (0:21:37.74)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : Someone... Anyone... (0:21:41.56)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : Please kill me! (0:21:46.64)
▶ Petelgeuse Romanee-Conti : I've been waiting for you, believer in love. (0:21:58.68)

▶ Petelgeuse Romanee-Conti : My, my, my... (0:22:07.69)
▶ Petelgeuse Romanee-Conti : The one you clutch to your chest there (0:22:09.33)
▶ Petelgeuse Romanee-Conti : wouldn't be the half-devil girl, would it? (0:22:12.53)
▶ Petelgeuse Romanee-Conti : How diligent you are! (0:22:15.29)
▶ Petelgeuse Romanee-Conti : Before we could even act, (0:22:17.64)
▶ Petelgeuse Romanee-Conti : you took the half-devil's life,
in the Ordeal's name! (0:22:20.09)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : I'm diligent? (0:22:23.62)
▶ Petelgeuse Romanee-Conti : That's right! (0:22:25.68)
▶ Petelgeuse Romanee-Conti : You are diligent! Fantastic! (0:22:27.32)
▶ Petelgeuse Romanee-Conti : Still... (0:22:32.96)
▶ Petelgeuse Romanee-Conti : Unable to overcome even one Ordeal, (0:22:34.47)
▶ Petelgeuse Romanee-Conti : much less to confront one of the sins, (0:22:36.94)
▶ Petelgeuse Romanee-Conti : and after all that waiting... (0:22:39.96)
▶ Petelgeuse Romanee-Conti : She trips over the first pebble
in her path, and it's over... (0:22:41.88)
▶ Petelgeuse Romanee-Conti : Ah, you are (0:22:45.84)
▶ Petelgeuse Romanee-Conti : truly slothful... (0:22:48.51)
▶ Petelgeuse Romanee-Conti : You saw the Unseen Hand just now? (0:23:01.04)
▶ Petelgeuse Romanee-Conti : No... (0:23:07.11)
▶ Petelgeuse Romanee-Conti : That's bad. (0:23:08.83)
▶ Petelgeuse Romanee-Conti : This isn't right! It's all wrong! (0:23:10.93)
▶ Petelgeuse Romanee-Conti : It's a mistake! A mistake! (0:23:13.10)
▶ Petelgeuse Romanee-Conti : My Authority... (0:23:18.59)
▶ Petelgeuse Romanee-Conti : The Authority of Sloth... (0:23:20.96)
▶ Petelgeuse Romanee-Conti : My Unseen Hand, which love granted to me... (0:23:22.99)
▶ Petelgeuse Romanee-Conti : No other can be allowed to see it! (0:23:27.29)
▶ Petelgeuse Romanee-Conti : You held her, as if she were
terribly precious to you... (0:23:42.28)
▶ Petelgeuse Romanee-Conti : But when the half-devil's body is torn
apart, how beautifully will you cry? (0:23:45.87)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : Stop... (0:23:56.96)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : Stop! (0:23:59.68)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : Please stop! (0:24:03.42)
▶ Puck : What are you doing? (0:24:14.85)
▶ Puck : What are you doing to my daughter, (0:24:20.74)
▶ Puck : you scum? (0:24:25.60)▶ Puck : Die. (0:00:12.47)
▶ Petelgeuse Romanee-Conti : My brain trembles... (0:00:19.63)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : Puck! (0:00:22.70)
▶ Puck : Be quiet, Subaru. (0:00:23.71)
▶ Puck : I don't care what you— (0:00:25.63)
▶ Petelgeuse Romanee-Conti : Complacency! Negligence! That is sloth! (0:00:32.10)
▶ Petelgeuse Romanee-Conti : You should have killed me right away! (0:00:35.00)
▶ Petelgeuse Romanee-Conti : Even with the power you have, (0:00:39.02)
▶ Petelgeuse Romanee-Conti : you failed to do what you needed to do! (0:00:40.94)
▶ Puck : Foolishness. (0:00:44.27)
▶ Puck : If you truly want to kill me... (0:00:48.02)
▶ Puck : Then grow a thousand shadows,
half of what Satella could... (0:00:54.30)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : Are you... Puck? (0:01:04.92)
▶ Puck : Can't you tell? (0:01:08.39)
▶ Puck : Maybe it's cruel of me to ask that. (0:01:10.30)
▶ Petelgeuse Romanee-Conti : Unbelievable... (0:01:14.88)
▶ Petelgeuse Romanee-Conti : This is unbelievable! (0:01:16.57)
▶ Petelgeuse Romanee-Conti : It cannot be! (0:01:18.60)
▶ Petelgeuse Romanee-Conti : A mere spirit... (0:01:20.64)
▶ Petelgeuse Romanee-Conti : My faith... (0:01:21.95)
▶ Petelgeuse Romanee-Conti : Everything I've devoted my love to... (0:01:23.31)
▶ Petelgeuse Romanee-Conti : At the hands of a mere spirit— (0:01:25.13)
▶ Puck : A human who's only lived a few decades
shouldn't talk to a spirit about time. (0:01:26.87)
▶ Petelgeuse Romanee-Conti : Time has nothing to do with
the depth of one's faith! (0:01:31.44)
▶ Petelgeuse Romanee-Conti : I wish you wouldn't liken me (0:01:35.07)
▶ Petelgeuse Romanee-Conti : to a fool like you, a being
that lives for eternity, (0:01:37.13)
▶ Petelgeuse Romanee-Conti : but wastes most of it in idleness! (0:01:41.03)
▶ Petelgeuse Romanee-Conti : Ah, my brain is tremblinglinglingling... (0:01:43.63)

the exalted witch's side. (0:01:57.30)
▶ Petelgeuse Romanee-Conti : And I'll receive her love. (0:01:59.79)
▶ Petelgeuse Romanee-Conti : I look forward to our reunion! (0:02:01.31)
▶ Puck : He quit while he was ahead. (0:02:05.63)
▶ Puck : Now, shall we have a little talk? (0:02:10.78)
▶ Puck : Subaru, you have committed three sins. (0:02:13.71)
▶ Puck : First, you broke your promise to Lia. (0:02:17.73)
▶ Puck : You don't seem to understand
how important a promise is (0:02:21.42)
▶ Puck : to a spirit-arts user. (0:02:26.47)
▶ Puck : Second, you ignored Lia's
wishes and returned here. (0:02:29.31)
▶ Puck : And third... (0:02:33.78)
▶ Puck : You let Lia die! (0:02:37.32)
▶ Puck : In accordance with my contract, (0:02:41.04)
▶ Puck : I will now destroy the world. (0:02:42.92)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : Why? (0:02:45.33)
▶ Puck : Lia is... (0:02:47.91)
▶ Puck : Emilia is my entire reason for existing. (0:02:49.99)
▶ Puck : There is no reason for me to
exist in a world without her. (0:02:53.79)
▶ Puck : The fog is coming closer. (0:02:57.78)
▶ Puck : It looks like a troublesome
one has been drawn here. (0:02:59.83)
▶ Puck : Gluttony... (0:03:03.51)
▶ Puck : Oh, I suppose they call
it the White Whale now. (0:03:05.07)
▶ Puck : You called it here, let Lia die, (0:03:08.40)
▶ Puck : and now, you die yourself. (0:03:10.80)
▶ Puck : You really are useless. (0:03:14.16)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : I've heard this laugh before. (0:03:19.95)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : The voice of a man I hated to death. (0:03:22.57)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : No... It's me. (0:03:26.59)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : I'm laughing at myself. (0:03:29.67)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : I let Rem die, killed Emilia, (0:03:31.90)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : and now, I'm going to die in vain. (0:03:34.46)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : I really am so... (0:03:37.29)
▶ Puck : You truly are slothful, Subaru. (0:03:40.97)
▶ Rem : Subaru-kun? (0:03:48.38)
▶ Rem : What's the matter? (0:03:49.82)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : Rem... (0:03:52.59)
▶ Rem : Yes, I'm your Rem. (0:03:53.85)
▶ Rem : I'm sorry I didn't notice... (0:03:58.14)
▶ Rem : This crowd is tiring you, isn't it? (0:04:00.73)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : Tired. (0:04:03.40)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : Yeah, that's right... (0:04:05.46)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : I'm out of energy, worn down... (0:04:08.48)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : I'm tired. (0:04:10.83)
▶ Rem : Subaru-kun! (0:04:27.05)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : Sorry about that... (0:04:35.87)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : I was feeling kind of stressed, (0:04:37.71)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : so I skipped out on explaining. (0:04:40.17)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : Sorry. (0:04:42.69)
▶ Rem : Really, you mustn't do that... (0:04:43.36)
▶ Rem : I realize that you are giving a great
deal of thought to our situation. (0:04:45.23)
▶ Rem : But I don't dislike it when
you are so forceful. (0:04:50.51)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : Sorry that I worried you. (0:04:53.35)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : I'm fine now. (0:04:55.16)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : I guess you've seen me just being pathetic,
depressed all the time... (0:04:56.62)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : But I get it now. (0:05:01.32)
▶ Rem : You get it now? (0:05:03.92)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : I've bothered a lot of people (0:05:06.66)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : with all my contemplating and agonizing, (0:05:08.76)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : but I finally figured out how
to take care of everything. (0:05:11.23)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : Or, when I really think about it, (0:05:14.59)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : I was told what to do from the very start. (0:05:17.28)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : But I don't know when to give up... (0:05:20.24)
▶ Rem : But I think that is what's so
wonderful about you. (0:05:22.76)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : Things I've realized
and been forced to realize... (0:05:28.28)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : All kinds of experiences have brought me here, (0:05:31.61)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : but I've actually had the
answer for a long time... (0:05:35.67)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : I've decided, Rem. (0:05:40.80)
▶ Rem : Yes? (0:05:43.23)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : Run away with me. (0:05:46.42)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : As far as we can go. (0:05:48.58)
▶ Rem : Huh? (0:05:53.30)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : I'm going to leave the
capital, to head far west. (0:05:54.81)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : Or maybe north. (0:05:57.62)
▶ Rem : Um... (0:05:58.76)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : I heard no one can enter the southern kingdom, (0:05:59.42)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : so one of those two. (0:06:01.66)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : I don't like cold weather, (0:06:03.01)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : so I'd personally recommend west. (0:06:04.56)
▶ Rem : Ah, um... (0:06:06.21)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : Honestly, it could be a long journey, (0:06:07.52)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : and I know this is a snap decision, (0:06:10.03)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : so it won't be easy— (0:06:12.00)
▶ Rem : P-Please wait! (0:06:13.23)
▶ Rem : The way you said that makes it sound as if (0:06:15.63)
▶ Rem : you plan to go to some other
country that isn't Lugunica... (0:06:19.09)
▶ Rem : Oh! (0:06:23.58)
▶ Rem : Knowing you, it must be because
you've had another great idea! (0:06:24.54)
▶ Rem : Something that will help Emilia-sama
and Roswaal-sama! (0:06:29.84)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : That's not what this is, Rem. (0:06:32.65)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : There's nothing I can do in the capital. (0:06:36.03)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : But I'd be just as powerless if
I went back to the mansion. (0:06:38.83)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : That's what I figured out. (0:06:43.85)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : So run away with me, Rem. (0:06:46.33)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : We can't stay here. (0:06:49.94)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : That's what everyone has been telling me. (0:06:52.05)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : I didn't want to believe it, (0:06:54.99)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : so I've denied it with all my might, but... (0:06:56.94)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : Yeah, they're right. (0:06:59.74)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : No one ever needed me. (0:07:01.46)
▶ Rem : That's not— (0:07:03.72)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : It is true! (0:07:04.56)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : It's been spelled out for me, over and over... (0:07:06.26)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : That's why I've decided to just disappear. (0:07:10.90)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : It's for the best. (0:07:13.84)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : Anything I do will just lead to a dead body... (0:07:14.70)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : Or maybe more, depending on what happens. (0:07:18.08)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : I've had enough. (0:07:21.65)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : Let's run, Rem. (0:07:23.82)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : You and I can't stay here. (0:07:25.39)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : We shouldn't be in this country! (0:07:28.09)
▶ Rem : But this is so sudden... (0:07:30.19)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : We don't have time! (0:07:33.18)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : I'm sorry it's sudden, I really am. (0:07:34.77)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : I really, really am. (0:07:37.45)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : But you have to choose. (0:07:40.89)
▶ Rem : Choose? (0:07:42.70)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : Me? Or someone else? (0:07:44.11)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : Choose. (0:07:46.78)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : Let's get a dragon-drawn
carriage and head west. (0:07:48.88)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : We'll leave Lugunica and go far
west... To Kararagi, was it? (0:07:52.31)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : We'll buy a little house
and live there together. (0:07:56.00)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : Even if bad things happen, (0:07:59.85)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : I can keep going if you're there. (0:08:01.42)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : Just having someone waiting at
home for me with a smile... (0:08:03.83)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : No matter how tired I am, (0:08:06.89)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : if I know you're waiting for me, I know... (0:08:08.23)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : Please choose me! (0:08:13.21)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : If you choose me, I'll
give you all that I have! (0:08:15.55)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : So please... (0:08:19.53)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : Run away with me. (0:08:21.51)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : Live with me! (0:08:23.21)
▶ Rem : Subaru-kun... (0:08:30.53)
▶ Rem : I cannot run away with you. (0:08:33.31)
▶ Rem : We're supposed to laugh together, (0:08:37.16)
▶ Rem : as we talk about the future, remember? (0:08:39.95)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : Maybe we can't laugh now, but... (0:08:43.69)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : You know, once we actually get moving, (0:08:48.00)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : I bet we can— (0:08:50.94)
▶ Rem : I have thought about it, too. (0:08:51.40)
▶ Rem : We would arrive in Kararagi, (0:08:57.06)
▶ Rem : and rent a place to stay. (0:08:58.86)
▶ Rem : As long as we had a home and work, (0:09:00.81)
▶ Rem : we would get by somehow. (0:09:03.66)
▶ Rem : Fortunately, thanks to Roswaal-sama,
I have received an education, (0:09:05.64)
▶ Rem : so I think I could easily find
work, even in Kararagi. (0:09:10.54)
▶ Rem : You might have to either
look for manual labor (0:09:14.71)
▶ Rem : or take care of things around me. (0:09:18.14)
▶ Rem : Once we had a stable income, (0:09:22.76)
▶ Rem : we could look for a better place to live. (0:09:24.74)
▶ Rem : In the meantime, you could study (0:09:27.63)
▶ Rem : for perhaps a year, so that you can find (0:09:29.56)
▶ Rem : a decent job, until you can actually work. (0:09:33.19)
▶ Rem : We would work together. (0:09:37.48)
▶ Rem : And once we had enough money,
perhaps we could buy a house. (0:09:39.04)
▶ Rem : Maybe we could even open a shop. (0:09:43.82)
▶ Rem : After all, Kararagi is a
thriving commercial area. (0:09:46.58)
▶ Rem : I'm sure we could earn a living
on one of your fanciful ideas. (0:09:49.28)
▶ Rem : And once our jobs were on track... (0:09:53.16)
▶ Rem : Um, it's embarrassing to say, (0:09:55.47)
▶ Rem : but we could have a child. (0:09:57.90)
▶ Rem : It would be half-demon and half-human, (0:09:59.55)
▶ Rem : so I'm certain it would be feisty. (0:10:01.61)
▶ Rem : Whether we have a boy or a girl, (0:10:03.92)
▶ Rem : twins or even triplets, (0:10:06.08)
▶ Rem : I know they would be adorable. (0:10:07.49)
▶ Rem : I'm sure it wouldn't be all fun times. (0:10:10.61)
▶ Rem : And not everything would
work out as I imagined it. (0:10:13.54)
▶ Rem : We might have only daughters and no sons, (0:10:17.84)
▶ Rem : so you might not feel very
proud of your family. (0:10:22.08)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : Rem... (0:10:26.37)
▶ Rem : But... But... Even when the children grow (0:10:27.08)
▶ Rem : and reach the age where they
start to treat you coldly, (0:10:29.77)
▶ Rem : I shall still be on your side! (0:10:32.97)
▶ Rem : We will be famous in the neighborhood
as a couple of old lovebirds, (0:10:35.39)
▶ Rem : as we take our time spending life
together and growing old... (0:10:39.29)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : Rem... (0:10:44.01)
▶ Rem : I would feel bad for doing it to you, (0:10:45.03)
▶ Rem : but I would prefer to die
before you, if possible. (0:10:47.75)
▶ Rem : I want to die quietly, (0:10:50.65)
▶ Rem : lying on our bed, with your hand in mine, (0:10:51.95)
▶ Rem : surrounded by our children and their children. (0:10:54.24)
▶ Rem : To say, "I was so happy," (0:10:57.31)
▶ Rem : as you all look on... (0:11:01.07)
▶ Rem : I could end my life happily, so happily. (0:11:04.81)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : If you... (0:11:10.11)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : If you want it that badly, then... (0:11:11.95)
▶ Rem : If you could wish for that
future with a smile, (0:11:16.06)
▶ Rem : I would be truly happy to die that way... (0:11:20.63)
▶ Rem : As long as I could live with you. (0:11:26.08)
▶ Rem : Just knowing that you want me
with you when you run away (0:11:28.86)
▶ Rem : makes me happy, from the bottom of my heart. (0:11:34.20)
▶ Rem : But I cannot. (0:11:36.76)
▶ Rem : Because I know (0:11:39.24)
▶ Rem : that if we run away together now, (0:11:40.95)
▶ Rem : I would be leaving behind the
Subaru-kun that I love most. (0:11:43.59)
▶ Rem : Subaru-kun, (0:11:49.51)
▶ Rem : please tell me what happened. (0:11:51.36)
▶ Rem : If you cannot, please trust me. (0:11:54.75)
▶ Rem : I swear I shall do something to make it right. (0:11:57.51)
▶ Rem : But for now, at least, we should go back. (0:12:01.93)
▶ Rem : If we take our time,
and consider things calmly, (0:12:04.16)
▶ Rem : maybe we will find a different answer. (0:12:07.32)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : I've already agonized over this. (0:12:10.72)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : I've thought about it. (0:12:12.70)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : I've suffered. (0:12:13.96)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : That's why I gave up. (0:12:15.74)
▶ Rem : It's easy to give up, but... (0:12:19.99)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : It's easy to give up? (0:12:24.76)
▶ Rem : Subaru-kun? (0:12:27.54)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : Don't give me that! (0:12:28.42)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : There's nothing easy about giving up! (0:12:30.04)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : You think I'm just doing nothing, (0:12:34.22)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : thinking about nothing, (0:12:35.87)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : cutting myself off from everything, (0:12:37.45)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : and throwing everything away! (0:12:38.82)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : And that's all it took to give up?! (0:12:41.33)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : It was not easy to give up! (0:12:46.10)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : It was so much easier for me to think (0:12:49.34)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : there was something I could do! (0:12:52.07)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : But there's nothing I can do... (0:12:55.32)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : There's no way out! (0:12:57.53)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : The only path everything
leads to is giving up! (0:12:59.55)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : If I could do something, (0:13:02.27)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : I would... I would... (0:13:04.39)
▶ Rem : Subaru-kun... (0:13:08.16)
▶ Rem : It is easy to give up. (0:13:11.47)
▶ Rem : But it doesn't suit you. (0:13:14.43)
▶ Rem : I do not know what painful things
you've been through, (0:13:19.37)
▶ Rem : or what you have done to make you suffer so. (0:13:22.77)
▶ Rem : And I know it would be wrong of me (0:13:28.16)
▶ Rem : to thoughtlessly say I understand. (0:13:30.30)
▶ Rem : But... But even so... (0:13:33.49)
▶ Rem : There is something that I do know. (0:13:36.24)
▶ Rem : I know that you're someone who cannot
give up on something halfway through. (0:13:40.19)
▶ Rem : I know that you are someone who can smile (0:13:46.92)
▶ Rem : when you talk about your
wishes for the future. (0:13:51.18)
▶ Rem : I know... (0:13:55.00)
▶ Rem : I know that you are someone who
cannot give up on the future. (0:13:57.00)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : You're wrong. (0:14:01.27)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : I'm not that kind of— (0:14:02.96)
▶ Rem : I am not wrong. (0:14:05.45)
▶ Rem : You haven't given up on anyone. (0:14:06.83)
▶ Rem : Not Emilia-sama or Sister. (0:14:08.82)
▶ Rem : Or Roswaal-sama, or Beatrice-sama,
or anyone else. (0:14:11.05)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : I have... I have given up! (0:14:17.08)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : Carrying it all was impossible from the start! (0:14:19.90)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : My hands are so small, (0:14:23.09)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : that it all slipped through
my fingers, leaving nothing. (0:14:24.91)
▶ Rem : No, that isn't true. You have— (0:14:28.16)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : What do you know?! (0:14:31.37)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : What do you know about me?! (0:14:34.18)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : This is the kind of man I am! (0:14:37.63)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : I have no strength, but I want it all. (0:14:40.25)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : I have no knowledge, but all I do is dream. (0:14:42.67)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : There's nothing I can do,
but I struggle in vain! (0:14:44.91)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : I... I... (0:14:49.11)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : I hate myself! (0:14:51.43)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : All I do is talk a big game, (0:14:54.78)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : and make myself sound like a big shot,
when I can't do anything! (0:14:56.99)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : I never do anything, (0:14:59.95)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : yet I can complain like a pro. (0:15:01.80)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : Who do I think I am?! (0:15:04.25)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : It's amazing that I can live like
this and not feel ashamed! (0:15:06.06)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : Right?! (0:15:10.06)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : I'm empty... (0:15:11.88)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : There's nothing in me at all! (0:15:13.43)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : I know that... (0:15:15.49)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : Yeah, that's obvious... (0:15:17.45)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : I know it's obvious. (0:15:19.31)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : Before I came here... (0:15:21.78)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : Before I got into the situation
that led me to all of you, (0:15:23.37)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : do you have any idea what I did? (0:15:26.08)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : I did nothing... (0:15:29.37)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : I've never done a single thing. (0:15:31.65)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : I had all that time, all that freedom... (0:15:34.89)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : I could have done anything, (0:15:38.20)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : but I never did a thing. (0:15:40.33)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : And this is the result! What I
am now is the result! (0:15:41.96)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : All of my powerlessness,
all of my incompetence, (0:15:45.84)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : is the product of my rotten character. (0:15:48.99)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : Wanting to accomplish something,
when I've never done anything, (0:15:52.42)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : goes beyond the limits of arrogance! (0:15:56.09)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : The cost of my laziness and all
the wasteful habits in my life (0:15:59.02)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : just ends up killing both you and me. (0:16:03.20)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : That's right. (0:16:07.85)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : I have no character. (0:16:09.12)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : Even when I thought I could go on
living here, nothing changed... (0:16:10.84)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : That old man saw that part of me perfectly. (0:16:16.00)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : Right? (0:16:19.99)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : I wasn't trying to get stronger, (0:16:21.13)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : or trying to make things better. (0:16:23.42)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : I was just striking an obvious
pose, to justify myself, (0:16:26.22)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : to say that I was trying, that it wasn't
like I wasn't doing anything. (0:16:29.96)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : I wanted to say I couldn't help it. (0:16:36.08)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : I wanted to be told that
it couldn't be helped! (0:16:37.79)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : I only pretended to push my body to the
limit, so that would be possible! (0:16:40.22)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : Even when I had you help me study, (0:16:45.99)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : I was just posing to cover up
how embarrassed I felt! (0:16:48.66)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : At heart, (0:16:52.69)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : I'm just a small, cowardly,
filthy piece of trash, (0:16:54.65)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : who's always worried about how
others see me. And nothing... (0:16:58.04)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : Nothing about me has changed! (0:17:02.29)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : I knew it all along. (0:17:09.77)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : That all of it was my fault... (0:17:12.04)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : I'm the lowest of the low. (0:17:15.03)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : I absolutely hate myself... (0:17:17.98)
▶ Rem : I know... (0:17:25.26)
▶ Rem : That no matter how deeply you
have fallen into darkness, (0:17:27.41)
▶ Rem : you still have the courage
to reach out your hand. (0:17:31.57)
▶ Rem : I love it when you stroke my hair. (0:17:36.34)
▶ Rem : I feel as if we can understand each other (0:17:39.84)
▶ Rem : through the contact between
your hand and my hair. (0:17:41.91)
▶ Rem : I love your voice. (0:17:45.69)
▶ Rem : Just hearing you say one word (0:17:47.98)
▶ Rem : makes my heart feel warmer. (0:17:49.50)
▶ Rem : I love your eyes. (0:17:52.88)
▶ Rem : Normally, they look stern, (0:17:55.18)
▶ Rem : but when you're being kind to someone, (0:17:57.12)
▶ Rem : I love the way they soften. (0:17:59.71)
▶ Rem : I love your fingers. (0:18:03.29)
▶ Rem : For a boy, you have such lovely fingers. (0:18:05.63)
▶ Rem : But when they clutch mine,
I know they are the strong, (0:18:08.41)
▶ Rem : slender fingers of a man. (0:18:12.22)
▶ Rem : I love the way you walk. (0:18:15.07)
▶ Rem : When we walk together, (0:18:17.68)
▶ Rem : I love the way you occasionally turn,
to make sure I keep up. (0:18:19.81)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : Stop... (0:18:25.77)
▶ Rem : I love the way you look when you sleep. (0:18:26.87)
▶ Rem : You look unguarded, like an infant, (0:18:29.30)
▶ Rem : and your eyelashes are on the long side. (0:18:31.32)
▶ Rem : When I touch your cheek, you calm down... (0:18:33.59)
▶ Rem : And when I playfully touch your
lips, you don't even notice... (0:18:36.27)
▶ Rem : And it makes my heart ache terribly. (0:18:39.68)
▶ Rem : I love you. (0:18:42.62)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : Why? (0:18:44.49)
▶ Rem : When you said that you hate yourself, (0:18:46.42)
▶ Rem : it made me want to tell you (0:18:50.32)
▶ Rem : all the wonderful things I know about you. (0:18:53.04)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : That was all phony. (0:18:56.11)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : You just don't know me! (0:18:58.33)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : I know myself better than anyone! (0:19:00.35)
▶ Rem : All you know is yourself! (0:19:04.07)
▶ Rem : How much do you know about
the Subaru-kun that I see?! (0:19:07.33)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : Why... do you like me so much? (0:19:14.42)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : I'm... (0:19:18.33)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : I'm weak and small. (0:19:20.00)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : I'm running away. (0:19:22.30)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : Just like I ran away last time! (0:19:23.37)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : So why? (0:19:25.90)
▶ Rem : Because you are my hero, Subaru-kun! (0:19:28.59)
▶ Rem : In that dark forest, (0:19:35.34)
▶ Rem : when I didn't even know who I was anymore (0:19:37.08)
▶ Rem : and couldn't think of anything
but violently lashing out, (0:19:39.93)
▶ Rem : you saved me. (0:19:42.95)
▶ Rem : When I woke up unable to move, (0:19:45.00)
▶ Rem : and Sister was exhausted after
using too much magic, (0:19:46.97)
▶ Rem : you faced the mabeasts as a diversion,
so we could escape. (0:19:49.66)
▶ Rem : There was no way you could win, (0:19:53.92)
▶ Rem : and your life was in real danger. (0:19:55.17)
▶ Rem : But you still stayed, (0:19:57.59)
▶ Rem : and came back to my arms, still warm. (0:19:59.57)
▶ Rem : When you woke up, you smiled, (0:20:04.15)
▶ Rem : and said the words I wanted to hear most, (0:20:06.15)
▶ Rem : when I wanted to hear them most, (0:20:08.40)
▶ Rem : from the one I wanted most to hear them from. (0:20:10.30)
▶ Rem : My time has been stopped for so long. (0:20:14.10)
▶ Rem : Ever since that fiery night, (0:20:17.86)
▶ Rem : the night I lost everything except my sister, (0:20:19.79)
▶ Rem : my time has been stopped... (0:20:23.03)
▶ Rem : It was you who melted my frozen heart, (0:20:27.04)
▶ Rem : and kindly made my stopped
time begin to move forward again! (0:20:30.94)
▶ Rem : I'm sure you have no idea how you saved me, (0:20:36.46)
▶ Rem : or how happy I was at that
moment, on that morning. (0:20:41.13)
▶ Rem : That's why I believe. (0:20:46.75)
▶ Rem : No matter what painful things happen, (0:20:50.24)
▶ Rem : even when it looks like you'll lose... (0:20:52.94)
▶ Rem : When no one else in the world believes in you, (0:20:55.74)
▶ Rem : when you don't even believe in yourself... (0:20:59.02)
▶ Rem : I will believe! (0:21:02.95)
▶ Rem : That the Subaru-kun who saved me (0:21:11.91)
▶ Rem : is a true hero. (0:21:14.90)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : No matter how hard I tried, (0:21:30.96)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : I couldn't save anyone... (0:21:33.12)
▶ Rem : I am here. (0:21:35.33)
▶ Rem : The Rem you saved is right here. (0:21:37.07)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : I've never done anything. I'm empty. (0:21:41.71)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : No one will even listen to me. (0:21:45.03)
▶ Rem : I am here. (0:21:47.88)
▶ Rem : I will listen to anything you have to say. (0:21:49.38)
▶ Rem : I want to. (0:21:52.39)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : No one expects anything of me. (0:21:54.52)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : No one believes in me. (0:21:57.09)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : I hate myself. (0:22:00.84)
▶ Rem : Well, I love you, Subaru-kun! (0:22:05.88)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : You really don't mind that it's me? (0:22:13.94)
▶ Rem : I want it to be you. (0:22:17.05)
▶ Rem : I would not want for it to be anyone else. (0:22:20.00)
▶ Rem : If you cannot forgive yourself (0:22:24.73)
▶ Rem : for being empty and having nothing, (0:22:27.53)
▶ Rem : then let us start from here, right now. (0:22:29.91)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : Start what? (0:22:32.75)
▶ Rem : Just like you started my time for me
when it was stopped, (0:22:34.64)
▶ Rem : we will make the time that
you feel is stopped for you (0:22:38.97)
▶ Rem : begin to move again. (0:22:42.17)
▶ Rem : Let us start here. (0:22:44.71)
▶ Rem : From square one. (0:22:48.13)
▶ Rem : No, (0:22:50.45)
▶ Rem : from zero! (0:22:52.49)
▶ Rem : If it is too hard for you to walk alone, (0:22:58.33)
▶ Rem : I will hold you up. (0:23:00.62)
▶ Rem : As we walk, we will share the burden
and support each other. (0:23:02.35)
▶ Rem : Wasn't this what you said to me that morning? (0:23:06.43)
▶ Rem : Show me how awesome you can be, Subaru-kun. (0:23:10.57)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : Rem... (0:23:16.89)
▶ Rem : Yes? (0:23:18.40)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : I love Emilia. (0:23:22.57)
▶ Rem : Yes. (0:23:27.47)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : I want to see Emilia smile. (0:23:29.42)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : I want to be of help to Emilia's future. (0:23:31.80)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : Even if she says I'm in the way, (0:23:34.60)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : even if she tells me to stay away... (0:23:36.44)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : I want to be next to her. (0:23:40.02)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : Using my feelings for her as an excuse, (0:23:43.47)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : to get her to understand everything (0:23:46.57)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : was arrogant of me, huh? (0:23:49.70)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : It's okay if she doesn't understand. (0:23:52.95)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : I just want to save her. (0:23:55.36)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : If there's a bleak,
painful future waiting for her, (0:23:57.82)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : I want to take her away to a future
where we can all laugh together! (0:24:00.78)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : Will you help me? (0:24:07.37)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : I can't do anything alone. (0:24:10.80)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : I lack in everything. (0:24:12.94)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : I'm not confident that I can
even keep walking straight. (0:24:14.91)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : I'm weak, fragile, and small. (0:24:17.47)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : So, to make sure I keep walking straight, (0:24:20.97)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : to help me realize when I'm wrong, (0:24:24.06)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : will you help me? (0:24:26.13)
▶ Rem : You are a cruel man, Subaru-kun. (0:24:31.14)
▶ Rem : You ask all this of someone you just rejected? (0:24:33.79)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : Hey, it's also hard for me to ask
this of the one who rejected (0:24:37.20)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : my once-in-a-lifetime proposal. (0:24:41.37)
▶ Rem : I humbly accept. (0:24:54.88)
▶ Rem : If it will help you, (0:24:57.59)
▶ Rem : my hero, (0:25:00.41)
▶ Rem : greet the future with a smile, then yes. (0:25:02.49)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : Yeah, just watch. (0:25:06.38)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : You get a front row seat... (0:25:08.91)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : To see the man you fell for (0:25:15.58)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : become the most awesome hero ever! (0:25:17.64)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : I'm watching you. (0:25:31.90)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : You're watching me. (0:25:34.60)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : So I won't look downward. (0:25:37.22)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : Natsuki Subaru's story will begin
right here, from zero. (0:25:39.25)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : My life in another world
starts here, from zero! (0:25:48.00)▶ Crusch Karsten : What? (0:00:14.49)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : Okay, I'll say it again. (0:00:16.06)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : An alliance between the Emilia and
Crusch camps, on equal terms. (0:00:18.17)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : For this purpose, I'll provide
the time and location of (0:00:22.57)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : the White Whale's next appearance. (0:00:25.52)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : That's the one card I can play. (0:00:27.90)
▶ Rem : The Witch's Cult? (0:02:01.87)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : Yeah, they're on the move and after Emilia. (0:02:03.39)
▶ Rem : Roswaal-sama feared that
might happen, as well. (0:02:07.58)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : I want to stop them, (0:02:11.79)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : but I don't have the fighting strength. (0:02:13.53)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : I have to start negotiating
now to pull some together. (0:02:15.64)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : Will you help me? (0:02:19.65)
▶ Wilhelm van Astrea : The White Whale? (0:02:27.71)
▶ Wilhelm van Astrea : Please forgive my indiscretion. (0:02:38.05)
▶ Wilhelm van Astrea : I suppose I still have much to learn. (0:02:40.60)
▶ Crusch Karsten : And? It is rather sudden that you
would bring up the White Whale. (0:02:44.13)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : Not at all. (0:02:48.48)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : When we began this negotiation, (0:02:50.34)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : I mentioned the magic stones found in
Roswaal's domain, in Elior Forest. (0:02:52.12)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : If sharing the mining rights is insufficient, (0:02:57.26)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : I need to offer something additional. (0:03:00.26)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : Crusch-san, I'm certain that my
information will aid (0:03:03.70)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : in your plan to subjugate the White Whale. (0:03:07.50)
▶ Crusch Karsten : Let me ask one thing, Natsuki Subaru. (0:03:10.91)
▶ Crusch Karsten : What gave you that idea? (0:03:14.22)
▶ Crusch Karsten : That remark was not one you might
pass off as a baseless accusation. (0:03:16.51)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : For these past few days, (0:03:19.86)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : some things have bothered me. (0:03:21.24)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : First, the increase in traffic
to and from your mansion. (0:03:23.12)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : It's been just a bit excessive. (0:03:25.64)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : Also, in the capital, I heard you've been
purchasing weapons and armor. (0:03:28.78)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : Plus... (0:03:33.34)
▶ Russell Fellow : If Crusch-sama's goal should be attained, (0:03:34.15)
▶ Russell Fellow : I'm sure it would suit your
desires, Wilhelm-dono. (0:03:37.56)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : You appeared to be planning something big. (0:03:41.24)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : Of course, I can't prove it. (0:03:44.95)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : Maybe I only made the connection (0:03:46.98)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : because I know the White Whale
will soon be appearing. (0:03:49.39)
▶ Crusch Karsten : I have another question, Natsuki Subaru. (0:03:53.18)
▶ Crusch Karsten : On what grounds do you know
that the White Whale will appear? (0:03:56.14)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : This. (0:04:01.24)
▶ Crusch Karsten : What in the world is this? (0:04:03.34)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : The moment before that happened... (0:04:06.19)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : It's what you'd call a metia. (0:04:13.12)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : It tells me when and where the
White Whale will appear. (0:04:15.89)
▶ Crusch Karsten : I find this a bit hard to believe... (0:04:19.78)
▶ Crusch Karsten : But I see that you are not lying. (0:04:25.02)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : I appreciate that, but are you sure
you want to believe me so easily? (0:04:26.96)
▶ Felix Argyle : Lies will get you nyo where with Crusch-sama. (0:04:31.48)
▶ Felix Argyle : She has the divine protection of wind-reading! (0:04:34.18)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : Uh, say what? (0:04:36.20)
▶ Crusch Karsten : When a person lies, a telling
wind blows around them. (0:04:38.03)
▶ Crusch Karsten : I can see that wind. (0:04:42.59)
▶ Crusch Karsten : You did not have that. (0:04:44.61)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : Does that mean you'll agree to an alliance (0:04:46.58)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : in exchange for my information
on the White Whale? (0:04:49.24)
▶ Crusch Karsten : You're getting ahead
of yourself, Natsuki Subaru. (0:04:51.27)
▶ Crusch Karsten : Whether I agree to it, (0:04:54.27)
▶ Crusch Karsten : and whether I believe
you are separate matters. (0:04:56.19)
▶ Crusch Karsten : My decision will determine (0:04:59.61)
▶ Crusch Karsten : the outcome of the royal selection,
if not the kingdom's very future. (0:05:01.34)
▶ Crusch Karsten : It cannot be made lightly. (0:05:04.60)
▶ Anastasia Hoshin : Mind if I listen in on this li'l chat, too? (0:05:07.83)
▶ Russell Fellow : Pardon us. (0:05:13.20)
▶ Crusch Karsten : Anastasia Hoshin... (0:05:14.82)
▶ Crusch Karsten : Russell Fellow? (0:05:16.84)
▶ Anastasia Hoshin : Well, y'all asked us to
come, and here you are, (0:05:19.59)
▶ Anastasia Hoshin : startin' without us. (0:05:22.33)
▶ Anastasia Hoshin : That's hardly fair. (0:05:24.03)
▶ Anastasia Hoshin : Let us in on this. (0:05:25.49)
▶ Crusch Karsten : Was it Natsuki Subaru who
asked you to come here? (0:05:27.05)
▶ Anastasia Hoshin : Well, to be exact, it was this
gal he keeps with him. (0:05:31.32)
▶ Anastasia Hoshin : I only heard the gist, (0:05:35.00)
▶ Anastasia Hoshin : but if you're really plannin' to subjugate
the White Whale, I look forward to it! (0:05:36.90)
▶ Anastasia Hoshin : For us business folk, (0:05:40.90)
▶ Anastasia Hoshin : whether the White Whale's around
is a life-or-death matter. (0:05:42.53)
▶ Anastasia Hoshin : Of course, our mercenary team will help y'all. (0:05:45.53)
▶ Russell Fellow : In addition to the White Whale,
I'm interested (0:05:48.56)
▶ Russell Fellow : in the concession that Natsuki-dono (0:05:51.43)
▶ Russell Fellow : proposed of mining rights to the magic stones. (0:05:53.28)
▶ Russell Fellow : If the alliance is formed, (0:05:57.37)
▶ Russell Fellow : magic stones from pristine veins (0:05:59.35)
▶ Russell Fellow : will be distributed to the capital
through Crusch-sama. (0:06:00.78)
▶ Russell Fellow : As the merchant guild's representative,
I cannot let the offer go unheard. (0:06:04.86)
▶ Crusch Karsten : Natsuki Subaru called you, as well? (0:06:08.54)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : I'll say it once more. (0:06:11.35)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : What I offer in return for the alliance is (0:06:13.23)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : a share in the magic stone mining rights (0:06:15.58)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : and information on when and where
the White Whale will appear. (0:06:17.99)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : In other words, the fuel needed
to subjugate the mabeast (0:06:20.50)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : that's terrorized the world for so long! (0:06:24.95)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : If what I say makes no sense
to you, forget I said it. (0:06:28.69)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : But if your goal and my wish align, (0:06:32.91)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : then let's defeat the White Whale. (0:06:37.36)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : Let's go on a hunt! (0:06:40.64)
▶ Crusch Karsten : I still have several questions, (0:06:52.02)
▶ Crusch Karsten : but it was brilliant of you
to expose my plans. (0:06:54.26)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : Then... (0:06:57.85)
▶ Crusch Karsten : I have questions, as well as doubts. (0:06:59.32)
▶ Crusch Karsten : Many things you say are unclear to me, (0:07:01.63)
▶ Crusch Karsten : so I have difficulty agreeing immediately. (0:07:03.34)
▶ Crusch Karsten : However... (0:07:05.99)
▶ Crusch Karsten : I shall choose to trust your eyes (0:07:06.95)
▶ Crusch Karsten : and the spirit that led you
to create this situation. (0:07:09.32)
▶ Russell Fellow : Then the deal is struck. (0:07:13.95)
▶ Russell Fellow : There were a few touch-and-go moments, (0:07:19.28)
▶ Russell Fellow : but I'm glad it worked out, Natsuki-dono. (0:07:21.74)
▶ Russell Fellow : I trust the promise we made prior
to the negotiation still stands. (0:07:23.92)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : Yeah, you were a big help, Russell-san. (0:07:26.37)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : Once the subjugation is complete,
I'll give you the metia. (0:07:28.84)
▶ Crusch Karsten : So you did lay some groundwork
before coming here. (0:07:33.43)
▶ Crusch Karsten : And you were waiting outside the
door for your moment to enter? (0:07:36.04)
▶ Anastasia Hoshin : But it was up to us when we interrupted. (0:07:39.03)
▶ Anastasia Hoshin : Well, as far as negotiations go,
I guess that just passes? (0:07:42.20)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : Took you long enough! (0:07:45.71)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : I thought you were never gonna enter! (0:07:47.02)
▶ Anastasia Hoshin : When negotiatin', there's always
a time to make your move. (0:07:50.13)
▶ Anastasia Hoshin : Well, as you're gettin' ready for
the subjugation and such, (0:07:53.69)
▶ Anastasia Hoshin : don't forget to patronize the Hoshin Company. (0:07:56.93)
▶ Crusch Karsten : You paved the way before negotiations began? (0:08:00.56)
▶ Crusch Karsten : You are surprisingly shrewd, Natsuki Subaru. (0:08:04.65)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : My preparation and review
paid off, that's all. (0:08:07.92)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : To be honest, I couldn't be more relieved. (0:08:11.02)
▶ Felix Argyle : Well, that's plain to see. (0:08:13.56)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : We managed to save face for staying
in the capital. Right, Rem? (0:08:18.16)
▶ Rem : Yes, you are truly wonderful, Subaru-kun. (0:08:22.29)
▶ Wilhelm van Astrea : Subaru-dono... (0:08:25.90)
▶ Wilhelm van Astrea : I thank you. (0:08:29.08)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : Huh? (0:08:31.23)
▶ Wilhelm van Astrea : I offer you gratitude (0:08:32.45)
▶ Wilhelm van Astrea : equal to that which I offer to my
lady, Duchess Crusch Karsten. (0:08:33.64)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : E-Er, that's, um... (0:08:38.33)
▶ Wilhelm van Astrea : As perceptive as you are, (0:08:40.84)
▶ Wilhelm van Astrea : I am sure you're aware, but if
I may introduce myself... (0:08:42.48)
▶ Wilhelm van Astrea : My family name is Astrea. (0:08:46.18)
▶ Wilhelm van Astrea : I took the previous Master Swordsman,
Theresia van Astrea, as my wife, (0:08:48.78)
▶ Wilhelm van Astrea : giving me the honor of the
bloodline's lowest seat. (0:08:52.97)
▶ Wilhelm van Astrea : That is who I, Wilhelm van Astrea, am. (0:08:56.08)
▶ Wilhelm van Astrea : I thank you for so kindly
granting this old man (0:09:01.36)
▶ Wilhelm van Astrea : the opportunity to slay the loathsome
mabeast that took my wife. (0:09:04.63)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : S-Sure! Of course I knew that! (0:09:09.78)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : I figured Crusch-san would accept
my offer, keeping that in mind— (0:09:13.26)
▶ Crusch Karsten : Natsuki Subaru... (0:09:16.97)
▶ Crusch Karsten : The wind of untruth is blowing from you. (0:09:18.69)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : I get it... (0:09:31.55)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : You bought all the dragon-drawn
carriages for this, (0:09:33.44)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : so that's why I had trouble getting
one back to the mansion. (0:09:35.90)
▶ Felix Argyle : You're still awake? (0:09:38.78)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : As if I could sleep. (0:09:40.39)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : Everyone else is working through the night. (0:09:42.46)
▶ Felix Argyle : They have nyo choice. (0:09:44.52)
▶ Felix Argyle : We have little time. (0:09:45.83)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : Yeah, the White Whale will
appear tomorrow night, (0:09:47.09)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : in the area around Flügel's Tree. (0:09:50.56)
▶ Felix Argyle : So, given the travel time,
we'll just barely make it. (0:09:52.41)
▶ Felix Argyle : Besides, can't you see it in
nyall their faces? (0:09:55.82)
▶ Felix Argyle : Nyot a single one is preparing unwillingly. (0:10:01.85)
▶ Felix Argyle : Everyone wants to be rid of the White Whale, (0:10:05.14)
▶ Felix Argyle : especially Old Man Wil. (0:10:08.44)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : He said it took his wife... (0:10:12.33)
▶ Felix Argyle : Yeah. (0:10:15.24)
▶ Felix Argyle : He's been chasing after the
White Whale all this time. (0:10:16.65)
▶ Felix Argyle : Ever since it killed the previous
Master Swordsman, his wife. (0:10:20.33)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : The previous Master Swordsman... (0:10:26.39)
▶ Felix Argyle : Well, now you know, (0:10:28.28)
▶ Felix Argyle : so you should stop worrying and get to sleep. (0:10:30.21)
▶ Felix Argyle : There's nyo thing you can do to help (0:10:33.13)
▶ Felix Argyle : with supply distribution
or organization, anyway. (0:10:35.48)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : That may be true, (0:10:38.36)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : but you didn't have to say it! (0:10:40.04)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : I'm supposed to pick whichever one I want? (0:10:52.27)
▶ Felix Argyle : What is it nyow ? You don't like them? (0:10:55.87)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : It's not that! (0:10:58.08)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : I'm glad you're letting me borrow one, (0:10:59.26)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : but I can't tell anything about their quality! (0:11:01.39)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : Do I look like a veteran who's studied
nothing but ground dragons for decades... (0:11:04.43)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : Are you that one from... (0:11:13.19)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : Looks like this is the one. (0:11:21.75)
▶ Rem : I am surprised. (0:11:24.51)
▶ Rem : This ground dragon is a type
known for extreme pride. (0:11:26.30)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : Felis, I'll take this one. (0:11:31.19)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : It's love at first sight! (0:11:32.73)
▶ Felix Argyle : Sure thing. (0:11:34.14)
▶ Felix Argyle : But don't say, "Love at first sight." (0:11:35.29)
▶ Felix Argyle : You're making Rem-chan pout. (0:11:36.98)
▶ Rem : I'm not pouting! (0:11:38.69)
▶ Rem : I'll be nice to it! I can do it! (0:11:40.64)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : Wha?! (0:11:55.69)
▶ Ricardo : My lady was tellin' me about you. (0:11:57.26)
▶ Ricardo : You're the star of this
little show, aren't ya? (0:11:59.71)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : That logo... And a Kararagi accent
from a demihuman... (0:12:02.63)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : Then, you're with Anastasia? (0:12:06.40)
▶ Ricardo : What, you knew? (0:12:08.16)
▶ Ricardo : I'm Ricardo, head of her mercenary team. (0:12:10.38)
▶ Ricardo : Nice to meet you, too, li'l lady! (0:12:13.17)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : Keep it down! Also, you're huge! (0:12:16.08)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : You'll snap my neck! (0:12:17.87)
▶ Ricardo : Hey! My lady! (0:12:19.19)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : Hey! (0:12:20.54)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : Ow... (0:12:22.41)
▶ Crusch Karsten : So that is the pride of Anastasia and
the Hoshins, the Iron Fang... (0:12:24.70)
▶ Crusch Karsten : I see. They all look quite strong. (0:12:28.80)
▶ Crusch Karsten : Did you rest well last night? (0:12:32.08)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : I nearly died a second ago... (0:12:33.23)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : Oh, so I guess you're also fighting? (0:12:36.14)
▶ Crusch Karsten : You think I am capable (0:12:38.97)
▶ Crusch Karsten : of sitting in a chair, waiting for good news? (0:12:40.47)
▶ Crusch Karsten : I'm more surprised that you are participating. (0:12:43.90)
▶ Crusch Karsten : Can you fight? (0:12:47.10)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : Nope, I can't. (0:12:48.50)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : But even if I can't fight, (0:12:50.04)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : I think this human will be pretty
useful against the White Whale. (0:12:52.58)
▶ Crusch Karsten : I must ask... On what grounds? (0:12:56.98)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : I'm not all that happy about it myself, (0:12:59.60)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : but I seem to be the type of
guy who attracts mabeasts. (0:13:02.52)
▶ Crusch Karsten : What? (0:13:06.51)
▶ Rem : It is true. (0:13:09.00)
▶ Rem : Thanks to that, Subaru-kun has
previously saved my life. (0:13:10.54)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : So, on my borrowed ground dragon, (0:13:14.17)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : I'll run around under White Whale's
nose and draw its attention, (0:13:15.71)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : while you guys launch an all-out attack! (0:13:19.73)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : That's the tactic I'd recommend, anyway. (0:13:22.20)
▶ Crusch Karsten : Under the White Whale's... nose? (0:13:25.21)
▶ Crusch Karsten : Shockingly, I sense no lies in that statement. (0:13:30.35)
▶ Crusch Karsten : I never thought (0:13:33.77)
▶ Crusch Karsten : I would doubt my divine protection as
often as I have in the past half day. (0:13:35.40)
▶ Crusch Karsten : They're here. (0:13:44.49)
▶ Conwood Melahau : Crusch-sama, we have arrived. (0:13:49.32)
▶ Conwood Melahau : Is this boy... (0:13:54.68)
▶ Crusch Karsten : Yes, he is. (0:13:56.30)
▶ Conwood Melahau : Thank you, young man. (0:14:00.57)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : Huh? (0:14:02.39)
▶ Conwood Melahau : Thanks to you, our wish may come true. (0:14:03.32)
▶ Conwood Melahau : We could not be happier. (0:14:06.19)
▶ Conwood Melahau : Thank you. (0:14:08.74)
▶ Rem : It seems all of them have a history
with the White Whale. (0:14:18.01)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : Then, they're like Wilhelm-san? (0:14:21.64)
▶ Crusch Karsten : Yes, many are men who have
retired from the front lines. (0:14:25.33)
▶ Crusch Karsten : They have joined our subjugation
force at Wilhelm's invitation. (0:14:29.74)
▶ Crusch Karsten : Their morale and experience (0:14:34.16)
▶ Crusch Karsten : is comparable to those of the
capital's active knights. (0:14:35.36)
▶ Felix Argyle : Crusch-sama, it's time. (0:14:38.69)
▶ Crusch Karsten : Right. (0:14:40.40)
▶ Crusch Karsten : Four hundred years. (0:14:47.81)
▶ Crusch Karsten : Since the White Whale,
created by the Jealous Witch, (0:14:49.77)
▶ Crusch Karsten : made the world its hunting ground, (0:14:52.25)
▶ Crusch Karsten : trampling the weak and dominating
the land as if it were its owner, (0:14:54.15)
▶ Crusch Karsten : four hundred years have passed. (0:14:57.95)
▶ Crusch Karsten : Countless lives have been lost in that time. (0:15:00.28)
▶ Crusch Karsten : Given its fog's unscrupulous nature, as well, (0:15:04.20)
▶ Crusch Karsten : the number of graves we cannot even
inscribe with names will only rise. (0:15:07.17)
▶ Crusch Karsten : But those days of sitting idle end today! (0:15:13.04)
▶ Crusch Karsten : Today, those of us here will end it! (0:15:16.68)
▶ Crusch Karsten : We shall strike down the White Whale,
and stop further tragedy! (0:15:19.10)
▶ Crusch Karsten : We shall give the sorrow, which fell
short of true sorrow, (0:15:23.39)
▶ Crusch Karsten : a chance to shed overdue tears! (0:15:26.34)
▶ Crusch Karsten : We move out! (0:15:30.62)
▶ Crusch Karsten : Our destination is Flügel's Tree,
on the Lifaus Highway. (0:15:32.15)
▶ Crusch Karsten : Tonight, we shall slay the White
Whale with our own hands! (0:15:35.61)
▶ Mimi Pearlbaton : I'm Mimi! Glad to know ya! (0:15:48.81)
▶ Hetaro : My name's Hetaro. Nice to meet you. (0:15:51.17)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : Yep, nice to meet you. (0:15:53.55)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : Anyway, not that I doubted it, but... (0:15:55.28)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : You really are the second-in-command, huh? (0:15:58.77)
▶ Mimi Pearlbaton : Huh? Have we met somewhere before? (0:16:01.27)
▶ Mimi Pearlbaton : Hmm... I totally can't remember at all! (0:16:04.94)
▶ Hetaro : C-Come on, Sister,
you have to sit up properly. (0:16:08.78)
▶ Mimi Pearlbaton : Totally can't... (0:16:09.87)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : Don't worry about it...
Just talking to myself. (0:16:12.56)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : I'm Natsuki Subaru. (0:16:15.25)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : So you two are brother and sister, huh? (0:16:16.59)
▶ Hetaro : Yes, my big sister and I will do our— (0:16:19.04)
▶ Mimi Pearlbaton : When Mimi and Hetaro are together,
we're the strongest! (0:16:21.04)
▶ Mimi Pearlbaton : And the captain's also here,
so we're the super strongest! (0:16:23.51)
▶ Hetaro : Uh, my sister and the
captain tend to be hasty, (0:16:26.73)
▶ Mimi Pearlbaton : Strongest! Strongest! Super strongest! (0:16:27.08)
▶ Hetaro : so I usually give the orders. (0:16:31.40)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : I see... (0:16:33.26)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : Must be rough... (0:16:34.96)
▶ Ricardo : What's the matter, bro? Ya look awful gloomy! (0:16:36.72)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : Whose fault is that? (0:16:39.22)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : A captain shouldn't make trouble for his men. (0:16:40.97)
▶ Ricardo : Hey, that's a nice ground dragon ya got there. (0:16:43.30)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : Hey! (0:16:45.77)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : Is it? (0:16:47.63)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : I borrowed this one because
it seemed to like me, but... (0:16:49.35)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : Come to think of it, (0:16:52.90)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : the ones you guys ride look kinda different. (0:16:54.11)
▶ Ricardo : They're called rigers. (0:16:56.30)
▶ Ricardo : But ya don't see 'em too often in these parts. (0:16:57.91)
▶ Ricardo : They ain't as strong as ground dragons, (0:17:00.32)
▶ Ricardo : but they're much more agile. (0:17:02.48)
▶ Ricardo : If it comes to a brawl against the Whale, (0:17:04.43)
▶ Ricardo : that's where they really
shine, so watch close. (0:17:06.33)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : Shouldn't you have had ground
dragons pull the cargo, then? (0:17:10.48)
▶ Ricardo : We've gotta manage our luggage on our own. (0:17:14.93)
▶ Ricardo : If ya think the White Whale's our only enemy, (0:17:18.57)
▶ Ricardo : you'll get the rug pulled out from under ya. (0:17:20.97)
▶ Ricardo : Ain't no guarantee we won't run into
thieves on the road, after all. (0:17:24.75)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : If anyone's got the guts to take on
a fully armed group like this, (0:17:28.73)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : they wouldn't settle for being thieves. (0:17:32.25)
▶ Ricardo : Good point! (0:17:33.86)
▶ Rem : It looks like Ricardo-sama is trying
to ease everyone's nerves. (0:17:42.56)
▶ Rem : Subaru-kun? (0:17:48.49)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : I thought I'd prepared myself for this... (0:17:52.36)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : You can tell the hero inside to awaken, (0:17:55.64)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : but it really isn't as easy as it sounds. (0:17:58.21)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : It's huge! (0:18:15.40)
▶ Rem : You sound happy, Subaru-kun. (0:18:17.87)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : Oh, looks like people have carved
their names into the trunk. (0:18:24.81)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : We aren't on some field trip. (0:18:28.28)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : That's just bad manners... (0:18:30.11)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : Rem, get me a chisel! (0:18:32.41)
▶ Rem : Even you should know that will
get you in trouble, Subaru-kun. (0:18:34.46)
▶ Rem : With me, for starters. (0:18:37.59)
▶ Rem : So the White Whale is coming here? (0:18:40.01)
▶ Rem : Honestly, I am opposed to (0:18:43.18)
▶ Rem : using the witch's scent to draw
the White Whale here. (0:18:45.55)
▶ Rem : It's too dangerous. (0:18:48.59)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : I'll use whatever I can. (0:18:50.00)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : If it gives us even a slightly better
chance of winning, it's worth it. (0:18:53.56)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : For a guy who lacks in every way, (0:18:57.72)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : I can only compensate with this method. (0:18:59.81)
▶ Rem : You are wonderful, Subaru-kun. (0:19:03.54)
▶ Rem : That metia will tell you when
the White Whale is coming? (0:19:09.60)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : Yeah, I set it to make noise when it's time. (0:19:13.74)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : To be honest, without this— (0:19:17.53)
▶ Rem : That's a lie. (0:19:18.65)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : Wh-What are ya saying? (0:19:21.68)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : If it's a lie, then how am I gonna... (0:19:23.88)
▶ Rem : You're speaking in something
like the Kararagi dialect. (0:19:26.13)
▶ Rem : It doesn't suit you at all. (0:19:28.99)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : No, no, no! I mean, there's no
way I could be lying! (0:19:30.72)
▶ Crusch Karsten : Even Crusch-san said— (0:19:34.09)
▶ Rem : It's all right, Subaru-kun. (0:19:35.49)
▶ Rem : I can always tell when you're lying. (0:19:37.53)
▶ Rem : I also know that you cannot
tell me why you do so. (0:19:42.22)
▶ Rem : So there is no need to convince me (0:19:46.44)
▶ Rem : or wrap everything in lies, (0:19:48.72)
▶ Rem : or try to take the blame
on yourself like that. (0:19:50.72)
▶ Rem : Because I have complete
faith in you, Subaru-kun. (0:19:56.89)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : Man! Looking up at this huge tree
really fires you up, huh? (0:20:06.90)
▶ Rem : Yes, it does. (0:20:11.34)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : If I don't look at it for a
long time, I won't relax! (0:20:14.34)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : I won't be able to look down for a while! (0:20:18.14)
▶ Rem : Yes, you're right. (0:20:20.61)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : I should say "thank you" instead
of "sorry" right now, huh? (0:20:25.61)
▶ Rem : You're welcome. (0:20:30.70)
▶ Rem : Besides, I am far more grateful
to you, Subaru-kun. (0:20:34.05)
▶ Rem : So we're even. (0:20:39.55)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : Uh... Wilhelm-san? (0:20:51.54)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : I heard a bit of the story from Felis. (0:20:55.62)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : That you've been seeking revenge on the
Whale ever since it took your wife. (0:20:58.80)
▶ Wilhelm van Astrea : Please forget that. (0:21:03.48)
▶ Wilhelm van Astrea : It was all time idly spent in
an old man's delusions. (0:21:05.46)
▶ Rem : You truly love your wife, do you not? (0:21:10.16)
▶ Wilhelm van Astrea : Yes, I love my wife. (0:21:14.25)
▶ Wilhelm van Astrea : More than anyone. (0:21:17.50)
▶ Wilhelm van Astrea : And no matter how much time passes. (0:21:19.23)
▶ Wilhelm van Astrea : My wife was a woman who
loved to look at flowers. (0:21:22.94)
▶ Wilhelm van Astrea : She never wished to wield a sword, (0:21:28.30)
▶ Wilhelm van Astrea : but the sword loved her more than anyone. (0:21:30.41)
▶ Wilhelm van Astrea : With no choice but to live for the sword, (0:21:33.79)
▶ Wilhelm van Astrea : my wife accepted her fate. (0:21:36.52)
▶ Wilhelm van Astrea : When I married her, I took it from her, (0:21:40.72)
▶ Wilhelm van Astrea : forcing her to abandon the title
of "Master Swordsman." (0:21:42.99)
▶ Wilhelm van Astrea : But the sword would not allow her to do that. (0:21:46.44)
▶ Wilhelm van Astrea : Subaru-dono, I thank you again. (0:21:52.00)
▶ Wilhelm van Astrea : In this battle, I can find answers
in my own sword. (0:21:55.52)
▶ Wilhelm van Astrea : And perhaps I shall finally be
able to visit my wife's grave. (0:22:00.26)
▶ Wilhelm van Astrea : At last, I can go and see her. (0:22:05.87)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : Let's work together to beat the
hell out of that damn whale. (0:22:13.00)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : I'll help with everything I have, too. (0:22:17.29)
▶ Crusch Karsten : Only a short time remains. (0:22:34.99)
▶ Crusch Karsten : Troops, be on guard! (0:23:01.36)
▶ EXTRA : I don't see it... (0:23:11.55)
▶ Crusch Karsten : It isn't coming? (0:23:23.74)
▶ EXTRA : Is that... (0:23:26.56)
▶ Crusch Karsten : Troops— (0:24:03.31)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : Let him have it! (0:24:03.79)
▶ Rem : Al Huma! (0:24:05.79)
▶ Crusch Karsten : Troops! Follow those two fools! (0:24:23.27)▶ Wilhelm ( Younger ) : I haven't seen you before. (0:00:42.06)
▶ Wilhelm ( Younger ) : What is a woman doing here
so early in the morning? (0:00:43.88)
▶ Theresia van Astrea : Oh, don't worry about it. (0:00:56.61)
▶ Theresia van Astrea : Just come here. (0:00:58.95)
▶ Theresia van Astrea : Hey... (0:01:16.17)
▶ Theresia van Astrea : Do you like flowers? (0:01:21.52)
▶ Crusch Karsten : Troops— (0:01:34.48)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : Let him have it! (0:01:34.99)
▶ Rem : Al Huma! (0:01:36.91)
▶ Crusch Karsten : Troops! Follow those two fools! (0:01:54.42)
▶ Rem : They're firing the night-banisher. (0:02:12.38)
▶ Rem : Close your eyes. (0:02:13.97)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : Whoa... (0:02:25.20)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : It's just like everyone said! Incredible! (0:02:26.47)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : That's... the White Whale? (0:03:11.20)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : It's so huge. (0:04:57.08)
▶ Rem : Are you scared? (0:05:00.09)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : Yeah, I'm scared... (0:05:02.92)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : of the blindingly bright future, (0:05:04.49)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : where I'm praised for defeating it! (0:05:06.54)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : Now, let's run like hell! (0:05:09.36)
▶ Rem : Yes. (0:05:12.11)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : It's so fast! (0:05:20.41)
▶ Crusch Karsten : You greatly underestimate us, (0:05:32.48)
▶ Crusch Karsten : looking away so carelessly. (0:05:33.86)
▶ Rem : The intangible sword,
without regard for range. (0:05:36.83)
▶ Rem : That is Crusch-sama's sword art, (0:05:39.60)
▶ Rem : famous for its Hundred-Man Strike. (0:05:41.44)
▶ Crusch Karsten : Disperse! (0:06:07.00)
▶ EXTRA : Disperse! (0:06:08.16)
▶ Wilhelm van Astrea : For fourteen years, (0:06:25.59)
▶ Wilhelm van Astrea : I have dreamed of nothing but this day. (0:06:27.64)
▶ Wilhelm van Astrea : Fall here, and leave your corpse behind. (0:06:32.37)
▶ Wilhelm van Astrea : You are naught but a monster! (0:06:47.41)
▶ Wilhelm van Astrea : How wonderfully cooperative of you, (0:07:10.99)
▶ Wilhelm van Astrea : coming here to be slain! (0:07:13.15)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : Oh, crap! (0:07:26.03)
▶ Ricardo : Don't you look away from us, moron! (0:07:36.72)
▶ Mimi Pearlbaton : Here, we go! (0:07:41.88)
▶ Hetaro : Everyone, now! (0:07:43.22)
▶ Crusch Karsten : Troops, get back! (0:07:48.40)
▶ Crusch Karsten : Fire at its flank! (0:07:57.96)
▶ EXTRA : Algoa! (0:08:00.60)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : Looks like that was pretty effective! (0:08:20.28)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : I think we can pull this off! (0:08:22.53)
▶ Rem : No, truthfully, (0:08:24.67)
▶ Rem : we had hoped that attack would ground it. (0:08:26.85)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : It's not losing altitude at all... (0:08:32.09)
▶ Ricardo : We used all of our best attacks
right from the get-go. (0:08:38.30)
▶ Ricardo : If that didn't make it fall, (0:08:41.86)
▶ Ricardo : it's a lot tougher than we thought. (0:08:43.85)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : The magic attacks didn't work? (0:08:47.39)
▶ Rem : Its white hair scatters mana
and disperses force. (0:08:49.81)
▶ Rem : My magic was not as effective
as it appeared, either. (0:08:53.50)
▶ Crusch Karsten : Fire! (0:08:56.97)
▶ Ricardo : Time for the second campaign. (0:09:02.97)
▶ Ricardo : Hack away at its reserve power! (0:09:04.49)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : Acting as a decoy now would be a hindrance... (0:09:16.79)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : So all we can do is watch
until it makes a move? (0:09:20.25)
▶ Felix Argyle : I feel just as irritated as you do. (0:09:23.27)
▶ Felix Argyle : I don't even have any attacks, (0:09:26.93)
▶ Felix Argyle : so all I can do is watch, anyway... (0:09:28.96)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : But with your healing specialty,
you're our lifeline. (0:09:31.51)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : Just fulfill that role for us! (0:09:34.98)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : We're counting on you. (0:09:38.12)
▶ Felix Argyle : You've really changed
in just one day, huh? (0:09:40.69)

you have to say it that way? (0:16:50.96)

to the foot of the tree! (0:16:54.84)
▶ Crusch Karsten : We'll have to use a bit of force. (0:16:57.92)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : With the ulgarm, (0:17:01.89)

to cover the whole forest. (0:17:03.60)

years utterly mad for you! (0:18:11.48)

but not all that strong! (0:18:21.52)

of a fight than it should. (0:18:25.70)
▶ Wilhelm van Astrea : I find it hard to believe this mabeast (0:18:29.89)
▶ Wilhelm van Astrea : got the better of my wife,
a Master Swordsman. (0:18:32.99)
▶ Wilhelm van Astrea : The fact that we got the jump on it, (0:18:36.18)
▶ Wilhelm van Astrea : and that it didn't use its fog to
divide our forces to start with— (0:18:37.82)
▶ Wilhelm van Astrea : I'll take one more thing before I leave! (0:18:47.06)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : Wilhelm-san! (0:18:59.38)

▶ Theresia van Astrea : Hey, have you grown to like flowers? (0:19:58.04)
▶ Theresia van Astrea : What is it? (0:20:03.77)
▶ Wilhelm ( Younger ) : There was talk of conferral, (0:20:05.52)
▶ Wilhelm ( Younger ) : and I became a knight. (0:20:07.27)
▶ Theresia van Astrea : Well, congratulations. (0:20:12.26)
▶ Theresia van Astrea : Then you're one step closer to your dream. (0:20:14.34)
▶ Wilhelm ( Younger ) : My dream? (0:20:16.76)
▶ Theresia van Astrea : Don't you wield a sword to protect? (0:20:17.88)
▶ Theresia van Astrea : A knight is someone who protects another. (0:20:20.89)
▶ Wilhelm ( Younger ) : I don't want... to die... (0:20:34.46)
▶ Wilhelm ( Younger ) : It's humiliating! (0:20:57.00)
▶ Theresia van Astrea : I see. (0:21:00.45)
▶ Wilhelm ( Younger ) : Were you laughing at me?! (0:21:01.52)
▶ Wilhelm ( Younger ) : Answer me, Theresia! (0:21:04.84)

▶ Theresia van Astrea : I won't... come here again. (0:21:20.24)
▶ Wilhelm ( Younger ) : With a face like that, (0:21:28.10)
▶ Wilhelm ( Younger ) : you shouldn't be holding a sword! (0:21:30.12)
▶ Theresia van Astrea : I am the Master Swordsman. (0:21:33.78)
▶ Theresia van Astrea : I didn't understand the reason why, (0:21:36.23)
▶ Theresia van Astrea : but I do now. (0:21:38.84)
▶ Wilhelm ( Younger ) : The reason... (0:21:40.60)
▶ Wilhelm ( Younger ) : Wielding a sword to protect someone. (0:21:43.59)
▶ Theresia van Astrea : That sounds nice to me, too. (0:21:46.68)
▶ Wilhelm ( Younger ) : Wait, Theresia... (0:21:52.88)
▶ Wilhelm ( Younger ) : I will take your sword from you! (0:21:56.06)
▶ Wilhelm ( Younger ) : I don't care about the role bestowed
upon the Master Swordsman! (0:21:58.77)
▶ Wilhelm ( Younger ) : Wielding a sword... (0:22:02.48)
▶ Wilhelm ( Younger ) : The beauty of a steel blade...
Don't look down on them, (0:22:04.96)
▶ Wilhelm ( Younger ) : Master Swordsman! (0:22:09.03)
▶ Ricardo : We have trouble! (0:22:24.33)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : You're kidding me... (0:22:53.96)▶ Mimi Pearlbaton : Captain? (0:00:10.95)
▶ EXTRA : How? (0:00:16.89)
▶ EXTRA : It's all over... (0:00:18.13)
▶ EXTRA : We're dead. (0:00:19.48)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : Don't let it swallow him! (0:00:23.88)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : If we extricate him before he's swallowed, (0:00:27.55)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : we can save him! (0:00:29.36)
▶ Rem : Subaru-kun... (0:00:38.70)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : Don't think this little bit of despair
is enough to stop me! (0:00:41.50)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : Giving up doesn't suit us! (0:00:46.56)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : Not me, not you, (0:00:48.60)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : not anyone! (0:00:50.37)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : Let's go, Patrasche! (0:01:16.06)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : Run right under the Whale's nose! (0:01:17.80)
▶ Rem : The only one who may sniff
Subaru-kun is me! (0:01:24.48)
▶ Crusch Karsten : Close your mouth! (0:01:37.31)
▶ Crusch Karsten : At a glance, the situation looks dismal. (0:01:41.72)
▶ Crusch Karsten : Where is Wilhelm? (0:01:44.59)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : If you remember him, (0:01:45.87)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : at least we know the fog hasn't erased him. (0:01:47.96)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : Everything depends on how well Rem fights. (0:01:51.32)
▶ Crusch Karsten : What do you think, Natsuki Subaru? (0:01:56.12)
▶ Crusch Karsten : Does nothing seem strange to you? (0:01:58.20)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : Strange? (0:01:59.78)
▶ Crusch Karsten : There are now three White Whales. (0:02:01.08)
▶ Crusch Karsten : If it is actually a mabeast
that lives in groups, (0:02:03.23)
▶ Crusch Karsten : how could we not know that by now? (0:02:05.31)
▶ Crusch Karsten : There must be some trick behind it. (0:02:08.26)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : And we need to find out, huh? (0:02:10.96)
▶ Crusch Karsten : If not, we won't hold out long. (0:02:14.48)
▶ Crusch Karsten : We'll do something. (0:02:16.56)
▶ Crusch Karsten : Retreat is no longer an option. (0:02:17.95)
▶ Crusch Karsten : Fire! (0:02:22.47)
▶ Crusch Karsten : "Fire," I said! (0:02:26.59)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : Crusch-san! (0:02:33.55)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : Willpower! (0:02:58.36)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : Damn... Being a daredevil isn't enough! (0:03:03.33)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : I've gotta use my head! (0:03:06.08)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : Why are there three of them? (0:03:07.46)
▶ Crusch Karsten : Duck! (0:03:08.94)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : Whoa! (0:03:26.19)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : Awesome! (0:03:27.45)
▶ Hetaro : We'll all back up Natsuki-san and Crusch-san (0:03:31.82)
▶ Hetaro : until the captain is fully healed,
and we can regroup. (0:03:35.45)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : Ricardo's still alive? (0:03:38.87)
▶ Hetaro : Yes, my sister took him to Felix-san. (0:03:41.11)
▶ Mimi Pearlbaton : He struggled a lot! It wasn't easy! (0:03:45.84)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : Gotcha... That's a relief. (0:03:47.88)
▶ Hetaro : On the verge of death, our captain
sent a message. (0:03:50.52)
▶ Hetaro : "Hey, it's gettin' a lot lighter. (0:03:53.58)
▶ Hetaro : The fact that I didn't die proves that!" (0:03:55.56)
▶ Hetaro : That's what he said. (0:03:59.64)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : "Lighter"? (0:04:00.64)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : What's light about a hard,
heavy situation like this? (0:04:04.09)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : Light? (0:04:11.76)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : That's it... I get it! (0:04:22.07)
▶ Mimi Pearlbaton : Huh? (0:04:25.41)
▶ Hetaro : Huh? (0:04:25.41)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : What? (0:04:33.97)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : Wilhelm-san! (0:05:02.95)
▶ Wilhelm van Astrea : Not skilled enough. (0:05:06.05)
▶ Wilhelm van Astrea : I was careless... (0:05:07.99)
▶ Hetaro : Is he all right? (0:05:10.10)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : Yeah, he's just unconscious! (0:05:12.05)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : Sorry, but could you take him to Felis? (0:05:14.60)
▶ Hetaro : Of course! What about you? (0:05:16.82)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : I realized something... (0:05:20.08)
▶ Crusch Karsten : It divided? (0:05:29.06)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : Yeah. (0:05:31.04)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : Its fighting strength and the left eye (0:05:32.27)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : that Wilhelm-san gouged out convinced me. (0:05:34.43)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : Your group's been engaging it head-on,
so you must have sensed it. (0:05:36.51)
▶ Rem : I was absorbed in battle, but... (0:05:40.80)
▶ Rem : You're right. (0:05:43.19)
▶ Crusch Karsten : I do agree with the conjecture that
that this one is weaker than the original body. (0:05:44.27)
▶ Crusch Karsten : But what good does knowing this do? (0:05:48.48)
▶ Crusch Karsten : Killing three White Whales is
much easier said than done. (0:05:51.48)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : We don't need to kill all three of them. (0:05:56.36)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : Just one should be enough. (0:05:58.75)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : That bastard's been making
its two doubles fight, (0:06:00.95)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : while it hangs around up there, watching. (0:06:03.73)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : What do you think it's doing? (0:06:07.15)
▶ Crusch Karsten : That is the real one? (0:06:11.05)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : It won't descend (0:06:13.08)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : because it knows it can't
let itself be killed. (0:06:14.32)
▶ Crusch Karsten : But... (0:06:17.97)
▶ Crusch Karsten : I cannot rely on my sword
to hit from this distance. (0:06:20.38)
▶ Crusch Karsten : If I had one strike, it might be possible... (0:06:24.20)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : I have a plan... (0:06:28.08)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : but it's a little too much of a wager. (0:06:30.66)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : You want in? (0:06:34.14)
▶ Crusch Karsten : I think you're insane. (0:06:46.88)
▶ Crusch Karsten : We're already insane for taking on
that huge thing in the first place. (0:06:49.20)
▶ Crusch Karsten : Perhaps. (0:06:55.94)
▶ Crusch Karsten : No, you are correct. (0:06:57.62)
▶ Crusch Karsten : That goes for everyone here right now. (0:06:59.62)
▶ EXTRA : Get away! (0:07:04.64)
▶ Crusch Karsten : We will hold off the two doubles. (0:07:13.08)
▶ Crusch Karsten : I will take your wager. (0:07:16.79)
▶ EXTRA : They're coming this way... (0:07:24.57)
▶ EXTRA : Stay away! (0:07:26.55)
▶ EXTRA : Run! (0:07:28.01)
▶ EXTRA : We'll be wiped out... (0:07:29.50)
▶ EXTRA : Crusch-sama! (0:07:59.10)
▶ Crusch Karsten : Stand up! Lift your faces! (0:08:03.68)
▶ Crusch Karsten : Take up your weapons! (0:08:06.04)
▶ Crusch Karsten : Look at that boy. (0:08:08.08)
▶ Crusch Karsten : He's so weak and fragile, (0:08:09.82)
▶ Crusch Karsten : a breath could blow him away,
and he's unarmed! (0:08:11.54)
▶ Crusch Karsten : He is a powerless boy, whose defeat
I have seen with my own eyes! (0:08:14.04)
▶ Crusch Karsten : He's weaker than anyone else here! (0:08:18.28)
▶ Crusch Karsten : Yet he's shouting louder than anyone (0:08:21.71)
▶ Crusch Karsten : that we can still do this. (0:08:24.49)
▶ Crusch Karsten : So how can we sit here, with downcast gazes? (0:08:27.41)
▶ Crusch Karsten : If our weakest man has not given up, (0:08:30.82)
▶ Crusch Karsten : how is kneeling in defeat acceptable for us? (0:08:33.86)
▶ Crusch Karsten : Did you all come this far (0:08:41.96)
▶ Crusch Karsten : to wallow in shame?! (0:08:46.42)
▶ Crusch Karsten : Follow me! (0:09:17.10)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : She has some nerve, calling me
a weakling and a loser... (0:09:32.21)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : Let's do this, Rem. (0:09:38.43)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : Time for the climax! (0:09:40.46)
▶ Rem : Right, Subaru-kun. (0:09:41.65)
▶ Rem : Al Huma! (0:09:51.23)
▶ Rem : Please! (0:09:58.97)
▶ Crusch Karsten : I'm counting on you. (0:10:09.23)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : Hey... Now that I see you up close, (0:10:12.11)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : you really are creepy. (0:10:15.04)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : Try to keep up with me. (0:10:22.81)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : Just so you know, I'm infamous for being (0:10:24.52)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : so annoying that no one can ignore me! (0:10:27.52)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : Okay, let's do this! (0:10:34.45)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : I'm doing you a huge favor! Listen up! (0:10:39.54)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : It's because of you, Rem died (0:10:43.12)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : and I experienced such a horrible trauma! (0:10:45.27)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : I made it back! (0:10:57.85)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : Rem! (0:11:11.81)
▶ Rem : Yes! (0:11:12.96)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : You saved me... (0:11:27.01)
▶ Rem : Thank you for the treat. (0:11:28.32)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : What are you talking about? (0:11:29.66)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : Don't let me down, Patrasche. (0:11:40.10)

▶ Subaru Natsuki : Show me how awesome you are! (0:11:43.40)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : Take this! (0:11:52.38)
▶ Crusch Karsten : Fire! (0:11:54.54)
▶ Wilhelm van Astrea : This is for my wife, Theresia van Astrea. (0:12:56.13)
▶ Wilhelm ( Younger ) : I win. (0:13:20.64)
▶ Wilhelm ( Younger ) : As a weaker swordsman, you no longer
have reason to hold a sword. (0:13:22.49)
▶ Theresia van Astrea : If I don't hold it, who will? (0:13:26.65)
▶ Wilhelm ( Younger ) : I shall inherit your reason
for wielding the sword. (0:13:30.68)
▶ Wilhelm ( Younger ) : You need but (0:13:36.48)
▶ Wilhelm ( Younger ) : become my reason for wielding it. (0:13:38.90)
▶ Theresia van Astrea : Hey, do you like flowers? (0:13:46.64)
▶ Wilhelm ( Younger ) : I don't hate them anymore. (0:13:50.36)
▶ Theresia van Astrea : Why do you wield that sword? (0:13:52.25)
▶ Wilhelm ( Younger ) : To protect... (0:13:55.77)
▶ Wilhelm ( Younger ) : ...you. (0:14:00.39)
▶ Theresia van Astrea : Do you love me? (0:14:05.32)
▶ Wilhelm ( Younger ) : You know that. (0:14:09.36)
▶ Theresia van Astrea : I still want to hear you say it sometimes. (0:14:11.78)
▶ Wilhelm ( Younger ) : Very well. (0:14:15.37)
▶ Wilhelm ( Younger ) : Someday... (0:14:17.06)
▶ Wilhelm ( Younger ) : When I feel like it. (0:14:19.66)
▶ Wilhelm van Astrea : Sleep for all eternity. (0:14:38.51)
▶ Wilhelm van Astrea : It is finished, Theresia. (0:14:56.72)
▶ Wilhelm van Astrea : At last... (0:15:00.66)
▶ Wilhelm van Astrea : Theresia, I... (0:15:02.46)
▶ Wilhelm van Astrea : I... (0:15:07.64)
▶ Wilhelm van Astrea : I love you! (0:15:12.80)
▶ Crusch Karsten : The White Whale has fallen! (0:15:23.38)
▶ Crusch Karsten : The mabeast of fog, (0:15:26.81)
▶ Crusch Karsten : which has terrorized the
world for four centuries, (0:15:29.05)
▶ Crusch Karsten : has been defeated by Wilhelm van Astrea! (0:15:33.00)
▶ Crusch Karsten : We have won this battle! (0:15:45.29)
▶ Crusch Karsten : Are you all right, Natsuki Subaru? (0:16:02.00)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : Somehow or another... (0:16:07.13)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : I'm glad you're also safe, Crusch-san. (0:16:10.05)
▶ Crusch Karsten : I am, yes. (0:16:12.64)
▶ Crusch Karsten : But our losses are not few. (0:16:14.38)
▶ Crusch Karsten : With the White Whale's defeat, (0:16:17.86)
▶ Crusch Karsten : those who have vanished will not return. (0:16:19.68)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : I think you did great, Crusch-san. (0:16:26.33)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : Your popularity should shoot through the— (0:16:29.33)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : Wait, did I just give you a boost in the
royal selection that I shouldn't have? (0:16:31.67)
▶ Crusch Karsten : That is quite a gloomy look on your face. (0:16:35.94)
▶ Crusch Karsten : You don't look like the hero who
brought down the White Whale. (0:16:38.91)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : The first thing Emilia-tan's gonna
do is to call me a traitor... (0:16:41.84)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : What did you call me? (0:16:46.37)
▶ Crusch Karsten : The hero who brought down the White Whale. (0:16:48.19)
▶ Crusch Karsten : I would not wish to be (0:16:51.32)
▶ Crusch Karsten : shameless enough to claim your
achievement as my own. (0:16:52.93)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : No, I really didn't do anything. (0:16:58.21)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : It sounds like your opinion
of me has improved a lot. (0:17:06.87)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : I'm surprised. (0:17:09.52)
▶ Crusch Karsten : There is no cause for modesty. (0:17:10.93)
▶ Crusch Karsten : In truth, I would love to welcome you (0:17:12.80)
▶ Crusch Karsten : into my household and reward
your accomplishments. (0:17:15.70)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : Please don't ask that of me! (0:17:19.26)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : It isn't about loyalty or allegiance, (0:17:21.30)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : but my faith already lies exactly
where it should. (0:17:23.68)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : I'll make Emilia the ruler. (0:17:27.95)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : Not for anyone's sake. (0:17:32.06)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : It's simply what I want to do. (0:17:33.66)
▶ Crusch Karsten : I was already aware of that, (0:17:38.75)
▶ Crusch Karsten : but it still stings a bit. (0:17:41.19)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : Honestly, I think you're an amazing person. (0:17:44.62)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : If I'd been on my own, I'm pretty sure
I'd have accepted your offer. (0:17:47.31)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : I'll be counting on you to
uphold the alliance. (0:17:51.57)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : Even if we end up as enemies, (0:17:54.30)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : I believe we can get along until then. (0:17:56.86)
▶ Crusch Karsten : Natsuki Subaru, allow me to
correct one idea you have. (0:18:01.73)
▶ Crusch Karsten : Even if we do find ourselves
in conflict one day, (0:18:06.66)
▶ Crusch Karsten : I shall remain friendly toward you. (0:18:09.56)
▶ Crusch Karsten : Even if the day comes upon which
we must settle things, (0:18:12.92)
▶ Crusch Karsten : I shall not forget the debt
I have incurred this day. (0:18:15.98)
▶ Crusch Karsten : Therefore, even if we do become enemies, (0:18:19.44)
▶ Crusch Karsten : I shall respect you and show
you favor until the end. (0:18:22.42)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : If I hadn't already had a
#1 and #2 in my heart, (0:18:31.18)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : that would've been a close call. (0:18:34.53)
▶ Crusch Karsten : I have not gone so far as to think
of you as a woman might. (0:18:38.35)
▶ Crusch Karsten : I do not deny there were occasions on
which my heartstrings felt a pull, (0:18:42.27)
▶ Crusch Karsten : but my heart lies at the end of my dream. (0:18:45.77)
▶ Crusch Karsten : Now... (0:18:57.74)
▶ Crusch Karsten : I shall leave (0:18:59.23)
▶ Crusch Karsten : to take our wounded and the White
Whale's carcass to the capital. (0:19:00.64)
▶ Crusch Karsten : But it would appear you still
have a duty to attend to. (0:19:05.27)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : Yeah. (0:19:09.04)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : It may sound rude, (0:19:10.25)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : but in a sense, that's what this
whale hunt was really about. (0:19:11.59)
▶ Crusch Karsten : Oh? (0:19:14.75)
▶ Crusch Karsten : Subjugating the White Whale was secondary? (0:19:15.45)
▶ Crusch Karsten : Intriguing. (0:19:17.89)
▶ Crusch Karsten : Do you require assistance? (0:19:20.54)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : I do. (0:19:21.88)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : But... (0:19:23.62)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : Frankly, I didn't expect the hunt
would exact this kind of toll. (0:19:24.98)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : On top of that— (0:19:29.20)
▶ Wilhelm van Astrea : In that case, why not
make use of this old man? (0:19:29.94)
▶ Wilhelm van Astrea : Natsuki Subaru-dono, (0:19:38.20)
▶ Wilhelm van Astrea : with this subjugation, (0:19:40.54)
▶ Wilhelm van Astrea : it was because of you that
I was able to carry out my reason (0:19:42.78)
▶ Wilhelm van Astrea : for living all this time. (0:19:47.64)
▶ Wilhelm van Astrea : I thank you... (0:19:49.56)
▶ Wilhelm van Astrea : I thank you. (0:19:51.34)
▶ Wilhelm van Astrea : I thank you with all that I am! (0:19:53.47)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : It was your strength that made
this possible, Wilhelm-san. (0:20:00.85)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : The reason I thought to defeat the Whale,
and could fight without giving up... (0:20:04.75)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : I don't know if it's okay
to say it like this, but... (0:20:09.24)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : Congratulations. (0:20:12.11)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : And thank you for your service. (0:20:13.74)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : I believe you were able to do this because
you loved your wife like crazy. (0:20:17.14)
▶ Wilhelm van Astrea : I thank you... (0:20:23.34)
▶ Crusch Karsten : You should hold on to that treasured
sword for a while. (0:20:29.78)
▶ Crusch Karsten : In the days to come, being unarmed
will do you little good. (0:20:34.26)
▶ Wilhelm van Astrea : Yes, my lady. Thank you. (0:20:36.99)
▶ Crusch Karsten : Take Felis and half of the uninjured. (0:20:38.89)
▶ Crusch Karsten : They should number about twenty. (0:20:42.38)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : Are you sure? (0:20:44.10)
▶ Crusch Karsten : I told you that I have
no wish to be shameless. (0:20:45.62)
▶ Crusch Karsten : And that I would respect you. (0:20:48.75)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : Thank you. (0:20:54.18)
▶ Rem : Why? (0:20:58.61)
▶ Felix Argyle : You cannyot move, right? (0:20:59.99)
▶ Felix Argyle : As a user of healing magic, I cannot
let you push yourself further! (0:21:04.01)
▶ Felix Argyle : You'll stay behind— (0:21:07.82)
▶ Rem : But... (0:21:09.06)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : H-Hey, careful! (0:21:09.90)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : Please obey Felis, and don't overdo it. (0:21:12.31)
▶ Rem : I shall not. (0:21:15.56)
▶ Rem : It hurts too much... I cannot bear it. (0:21:16.86)
▶ Rem : When you're in trouble, (0:21:19.57)
▶ Rem : I want to be the first to reach out to you. (0:21:21.52)
▶ Rem : That is all I want! So please... (0:21:25.36)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : In that case, you don't have to worry. (0:21:28.48)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : You've already saved me so many times. (0:21:32.40)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : Don't you realize how much you've
done for me up till now? (0:21:36.70)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : I want you to help me from now on, too. (0:21:41.39)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : So, this time, leave everything to me. (0:21:44.69)
▶ Rem : After this, you'll still keep me by your side? (0:21:49.82)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : I'm the one who should beg you for that. (0:21:54.41)
▶ Rem : I shall take that as a promise. (0:22:00.40)
▶ Rem : You cannot back out now. (0:22:02.90)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : It'll be okay, Rem. (0:22:10.06)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : I'll find a way to take care of everything! (0:22:11.88)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : I'm your hero! (0:22:14.82)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : I've decided to take that first step! (0:22:16.98)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : But you don't have to worry! (0:22:19.97)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : I managed to pull off the whale hunt. (0:22:22.02)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : Right now, your hero
is fanatical like a demon. (0:22:24.23)
▶ Rem : Subaru-kun... (0:22:28.57)
▶ Rem : All right! (0:22:35.09)
▶ Rem : My hero is the greatest in the world! (0:22:36.83)
▶ Ricardo : Man, you really got all the
good parts back there, y'know? (0:22:57.79)
▶ Mimi Pearlbaton : Captain... Mimi, too! Mimi, too! (0:23:02.89)
▶ Mimi Pearlbaton : I did super-duper good! (0:23:05.19)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : Didn't you almost die? (0:23:07.54)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : Also, your brother was exhausted. (0:23:09.84)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : How do you have so much energy? (0:23:12.57)
▶ Mimi Pearlbaton : Hetaro's just a baby. He's weak. (0:23:14.52)
▶ Mimi Pearlbaton : Really, it's so pathetic... (0:23:17.08)
▶ Ricardo : Later in the battle with the Whale,
I didn't get much done, (0:23:20.02)
▶ Ricardo : but don't you worry. (0:23:23.26)
▶ Ricardo : My lady asked me for a favor, after all. (0:23:24.86)
▶ Ricardo : In the real battle comin' up,
I'll show ya what I've got. (0:23:27.58)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : The real battle? (0:23:30.67)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : What're you trying to do here? (0:23:32.09)
▶ Ricardo : You're takin' on the Witch's Cult, right? (0:23:33.74)
▶ Ricardo : Never underestimate the merchant
information network. (0:23:37.01)
▶ Ricardo : Ah, here they come. (0:23:40.36)
▶ Ricardo : That's half of our mercenary team. (0:23:46.19)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : Half? (0:23:48.62)
▶ Ricardo : Half of 'em were sent to block the road, (0:23:49.91)
▶ Ricardo : instead of fightin' the Whale. (0:23:52.91)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : They're going to help us, too? (0:23:55.65)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : Who's leading them? (0:23:58.13)
▶ Mimi Pearlbaton : My younger brother, Tivey! (0:23:59.86)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : You have another younger brother? (0:24:02.65)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : I'm really curious to know if
he's more like you or Hetaro. (0:24:04.86)
▶ Mimi Pearlbaton : Hey! (0:24:14.98)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : Why is he with them? (0:24:21.31)▶ Felix Argyle : Just now joining us, Julius? (0:00:10.86)
▶ Felix Argyle : Thanks for gracing us with your presence. (0:00:12.99)
▶ Julius Euclius : Please... You will ruin my reputation. (0:00:15.70)
▶ Julius Euclius : But I am not the man called "Julius." (0:00:18.87)
▶ Julius Euclius : Let's see... (0:00:23.66)
▶ Julius Euclius : Perhaps I shall go by "Juli." (0:00:25.33)
▶ Julius Euclius : Even if it is temporary, (0:00:28.63)
▶ Julius Euclius : a man with a knight's status
must never lower himself (0:00:30.38)
▶ Julius Euclius : to the rank of mercenary. (0:00:34.26)
▶ Julius Euclius : The man you see here is not
Julius Euclius, the knight, (0:00:36.34)
▶ Julius Euclius : but a simple wanderer called Juli. (0:00:41.06)
▶ Felix Argyle : A proper household's code of
chivalry is a real pain, huh? (0:00:44.18)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : Bull... (0:00:47.07)
▶ Julius Euclius : It seems you're doing better than I expected. (0:00:49.52)
▶ Julius Euclius : How are you feeling? (0:00:52.15)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : Well, there were only some scratches! (0:00:55.65)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : A little spit fixed them right up! (0:00:58.03)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : What about you? (0:01:00.95)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : Been busy writing apologies (0:01:01.91)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : for fighting so seriously with an amateur? (0:01:04.12)
▶ Julius Euclius : I didn't mean that... (0:01:08.46)
▶ Julius Euclius : I was talking about the damage to your
honor by the mabeast subjugation. (0:01:10.29)
▶ Julius Euclius : But I'm glad your wounds from
before seem to have healed. (0:01:16.47)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : Thanks to all of you, we succeeded
in defeating the White Whale. (0:01:27.23)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : But it's not over yet. (0:01:30.73)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : I have to settle a score with the Witch's
Cult guys that picked a fight with me. (0:01:33.28)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : Once that's done, (0:01:38.24)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : the White Whale subjugation will be complete. (0:01:39.28)
▶ Mimi Pearlbaton : The Witch's Cult is next?! (0:01:41.58)
▶ Tivey : Can we trust allegations that the White Whale
and the Witch's Cult are connected? (0:01:43.41)
▶ Tivey : We only came as reinforcements for
the White Whale's subjugation— (0:01:48.00)
▶ Tivey : What was that for? (0:01:51.88)
▶ Mimi Pearlbaton : If you can't believe him, (0:01:53.21)
▶ Mimi Pearlbaton : then you just need to believe me! (0:01:55.22)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : I'd prefer it if you believed me, though. (0:01:58.55)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : I don't like to recall it, (0:02:03.22)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : but I've run up against
the Witch's Cult before. (0:02:05.10)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : I learned it then. (0:02:07.73)
▶ Felix Argyle : Didn't you look into that, Old Man Wil? (0:02:09.44)
▶ Wilhelm van Astrea : I would not term it definitive evidence, (0:02:12.73)
▶ Wilhelm van Astrea : but the distributions of Whale
appearances and Cult activities (0:02:15.44)
▶ Wilhelm van Astrea : coincided in several respects. (0:02:18.74)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : That makes it doubly credible! (0:02:21.95)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : On that note, (0:02:24.70)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : we're going to head
for the Mathers domain. (0:02:25.70)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : The Witch's Cult is hiding in the forest there. (0:02:28.75)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : The way we defeat them
is as simple as it gets. (0:02:31.25)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : Raid them before they can
read our movements, (0:02:34.13)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : and crush them! (0:02:36.84)
▶ Conwood Melahau : Is there a way to protect the villagers? (0:02:38.34)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : I asked Anastasia-san and Russell-san (0:02:41.68)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : to talk to the merchants along the highway. (0:02:43.97)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : Under the condition that Margrave Mathers
buys their cargo at asking prices, (0:02:47.89)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : they'll ask the merchants
to evacuate the Arlam (0:02:52.44)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : villagers and Roswaal mansion residents. (0:02:54.90)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : And a messenger from Crusch-san's household (0:02:58.15)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : is headed for the mansion
with a handwritten letter. (0:03:01.24)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : There will be chaos (0:03:03.99)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : if we don't notify Emilia and the rest
about the alliance and such. (0:03:05.74)
▶ Ricardo : Sounds like we're all ready. (0:03:09.04)
▶ Tivey : Yeah! (0:03:11.08)
▶ Mimi Pearlbaton : Yeah! (0:03:11.08)
▶ Wilhelm van Astrea : We have never enjoyed such an advantage
in a battle with the Witch's Cult. (0:03:12.75)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : Yeah. (0:03:17.67)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : With Julius and his crew, we don't have
to worry about being outnumbered. (0:03:18.80)
▶ Julius Euclius : I would like to offer one correction. (0:03:24.64)
▶ Julius Euclius : My name is Juli. (0:03:28.06)
▶ Julius Euclius : Please take care to use it. (0:03:30.35)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : That'll just be a hassle in casual settings! (0:03:31.77)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : The battle with the White Whale
was so tough, I thought I'd die. (0:03:38.65)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : Some of us did die. (0:03:43.49)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : Some others vanished, never to return. (0:03:46.41)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : Let's win the war without losing anyone here. (0:03:52.54)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : Let's all return home alive! (0:03:56.92)
▶ Julius Euclius : You really managed to win? (0:04:06.66)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : Huh? (0:04:08.81)
▶ Julius Euclius : The subjugation of the White Whale (0:04:10.02)
▶ Julius Euclius : was a long-standing wish
of the Imperial Knights. (0:04:12.39)
▶ Julius Euclius : It seems I owe you my thanks. (0:04:18.23)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : You don't have to force it. (0:04:21.11)
▶ Julius Euclius : For putting an end to a calamity that
all nations ignored for far too long, (0:04:23.32)
▶ Julius Euclius : I thank you. (0:04:28.82)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : I'm... (0:04:33.96)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : grateful to you, too. (0:04:35.92)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : For coming to back us up. (0:04:37.96)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : Even after what happened. (0:04:40.34)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : About that, I was... (0:04:43.09)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : Oh, damn it! Crap! (0:04:46.76)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : I know, okay? I know it now! (0:04:48.93)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : It was my fault. (0:04:53.61)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : Sorry. I... I apologize. (0:04:55.55)
▶ Julius Euclius : I apologize, as well. (0:05:00.69)
▶ Julius Euclius : I cannot take back my words and actions, (0:05:03.36)
▶ Julius Euclius : but I apologize, from the bottom
of my heart, for belittling you. (0:05:08.12)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : I'm sorry, but... (0:05:12.04)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : I hate your guts. (0:05:16.08)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : I feel bad for what happened,
and I'm grateful you're here. (0:05:18.50)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : But I hate your guts. (0:05:22.34)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : Seriously, I hate you from
the bottom of my heart! (0:05:25.47)
▶ Julius Euclius : That is fine. (0:05:32.85)
▶ Julius Euclius : I have no intention
of befriending you, either. (0:05:34.31)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : All right, as I say every time,
let's get this fight started. (0:05:43.28)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : Fate, bring it on! (0:05:46.82)
▶ Puck : You must be exhausted, Lia. (0:06:07.01)
▶ Puck : You should rest a bit. (0:06:08.72)
▶ Emilia : No. (0:06:11.01)
▶ Emilia : I don't think I'll be able to fall asleep. (0:06:12.51)
▶ Emilia : What about you? Aren't you tired? (0:06:15.56)
▶ Puck : I'm fine. (0:06:17.48)
▶ Puck : The forest barrier is all fixed up, too. (0:06:19.06)
▶ Puck : You don't have to worry about anything! (0:06:21.52)
▶ Emilia : Yeah. (0:06:23.54)
▶ Emilia : But... (0:06:26.40)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : This feels like the time (0:06:39.54)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : I found a cockroach in the
corner of a quiet room. (0:06:42.13)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : You were drawn to the smell, huh? (0:06:46.05)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : Perfect cockroach bait... (0:06:48.09)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : Do I really smell that bad? (0:06:51.18)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : Thanks for coming to meet me. (0:06:55.64)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : Sorry to say it when you just arrived, (0:06:57.56)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : but I'll leave you to work the
details out for yourselves. (0:06:59.69)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : So don't get in my way. (0:07:02.60)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : If they'd stuck around long enough
for me to order them (0:07:08.24)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : to gather their stuff and go home,
this would've been easier... (0:07:11.32)
▶ Petelgeuse Romanee-Conti : I have been waiting for you, believer in love. (0:07:23.04)
▶ Petelgeuse Romanee-Conti : In the Witch's Cult, I am a Sin Archbishop,
representing sloth, (0:07:27.30)
▶ Petelgeuse Romanee-Conti : Betelgeuse Romanée-Conti. (0:07:31.80)
▶ Petelgeuse Romanee-Conti : I welcome you,
beloved child, blessed with love. (0:07:36.31)
▶ Petelgeuse Romanee-Conti : Wonderful! (0:07:39.85)

▶ Subaru Natsuki : Hey. (0:07:46.23)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : I really appreciate the unexpected welcome. (0:07:48.57)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : But I'm not sure I really feel this
"love" you keep bringing up. (0:07:51.78)
▶ Petelgeuse Romanee-Conti : It always begins suddenly. (0:07:55.28)
▶ Petelgeuse Romanee-Conti : Everyone, on a certain day, (0:07:57.41)
▶ Petelgeuse Romanee-Conti : realizes that they are loved. (0:07:59.29)
▶ Petelgeuse Romanee-Conti : They feel the love! (0:08:01.83)
▶ Petelgeuse Romanee-Conti : The love! The love! The love! The love!
The love! The love! The love! (0:08:03.17)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : Um, and what am I supposed to do now? (0:08:07.21)
▶ Petelgeuse Romanee-Conti : Ah, the witch's generous love... (0:08:11.59)
▶ Petelgeuse Romanee-Conti : You wouldn't happen to be Pride, would you? (0:08:15.55)
▶ Petelgeuse Romanee-Conti : Of the six Sin Archbishops, (0:08:20.43)
▶ Petelgeuse Romanee-Conti : only Pride's seat remains vacant... (0:08:22.85)
▶ Petelgeuse Romanee-Conti : You have (0:08:27.36)
▶ Petelgeuse Romanee-Conti : received the Gospel, haven't you? (0:08:29.32)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : The Gospel? (0:08:33.11)
▶ Petelgeuse Romanee-Conti : My brain (0:08:35.78)
▶ Petelgeuse Romanee-Conti : trembles! (0:08:37.45)
▶ Petelgeuse Romanee-Conti : Presentation of the Gospel, (0:08:41.87)
▶ Petelgeuse Romanee-Conti : proof of love... (0:08:43.41)
▶ Petelgeuse Romanee-Conti : Proof! Proof! Proof! Proof! (0:08:45.21)
▶ Petelgeuse Romanee-Conti : Huh? (0:08:49.84)
▶ Petelgeuse Romanee-Conti : My Gospel has no account of you. (0:08:52.55)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : That book is the Gospel? (0:08:56.27)
▶ Petelgeuse Romanee-Conti : Then why did you appear here? (0:08:58.97)
▶ Petelgeuse Romanee-Conti : Why visit here? (0:09:02.27)
▶ Petelgeuse Romanee-Conti : What fortune are you here to deliver?! (0:09:03.40)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : Oh! So that's the Gospel! (0:09:07.94)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : I see, I see... (0:09:10.80)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : I understand, I understand. (0:09:12.49)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : You should have just said so. (0:09:14.61)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : Aw, darn it! I'm sorry! (0:09:18.66)
▶ Petelgeuse Romanee-Conti : What? (0:09:22.04)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : My Gospel is, well, you know... (0:09:23.62)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : I used it as a coaster, and it got messy. (0:09:27.75)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : So I threw it out. (0:09:31.38)
▶ Petelgeuse Romanee-Conti : Proof of love! (0:09:38.22)
▶ Petelgeuse Romanee-Conti : Authority of Sloth... (0:09:39.62)
▶ Petelgeuse Romanee-Conti : Unseen Hand! (0:09:41.34)
▶ Petelgeuse Romanee-Conti : What? (0:09:44.80)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : It's an "unseen hand," right? (0:09:45.85)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : So if I can see it, I can evade it! (0:09:47.90)
▶ Petelgeuse Romanee-Conti : You can see my Unseen Hand?! (0:09:50.90)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : Okay, I'm just about done buying time! (0:09:54.15)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : Prepare to be buried alive! (0:10:11.71)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : Suffer, as you regret the things you've done! (0:10:13.71)
▶ Petelgeuse Romanee-Conti : How... How could this be? (0:10:17.47)
▶ Petelgeuse Romanee-Conti : My fingers, so cruelly, so mercilessly, (0:10:20.93)
▶ Petelgeuse Romanee-Conti : so chaotically, so arbitrarily,
so artlessly, so meaninglessly... (0:10:26.43)
▶ Petelgeuse Romanee-Conti : My brain... My brain trembles! (0:10:33.69)
▶ Mimi Pearlbaton : Yikes, that guy's kinda scary. (0:10:38.32)
▶ Tivey : I think all the Witch's Cult
members are like that. (0:10:41.20)
▶ Petelgeuse Romanee-Conti : Yes, of course... (0:10:46.51)
▶ Petelgeuse Romanee-Conti : Fine... Fine. (0:10:50.42)
▶ Petelgeuse Romanee-Conti : I understand. Let's do this.
I'm ready to do this. (0:10:52.88)
▶ Petelgeuse Romanee-Conti : The time has come to learn which
of us is worthy of her love! (0:10:56.67)
▶ Petelgeuse Romanee-Conti : Her love! Yes, her love! (0:11:01.55)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : Sorry to interrupt your fun, but... (0:11:04.27)
▶ Petelgeuse Romanee-Conti : —ove? (0:11:07.06)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : I have someone else lined up to take you on! (0:11:08.46)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : I-It's over... Right? (0:11:24.96)
▶ Felix Argyle : He's very much dead! (0:11:28.84)
▶ Felix Argyle : The capital's most powerful
healer guarantees it. (0:11:30.92)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : I see... (0:11:34.59)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : Wilhelm-san, I'm sorry to ask
such an unreasonable favor. (0:11:37.01)
▶ Wilhelm van Astrea : Was it unreasonable? (0:11:40.81)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : Isn't cutting someone down
without warning, from behind, (0:11:43.23)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : the worst thing a knight can do? (0:11:46.43)
▶ Wilhelm van Astrea : Chivalry is long dead. (0:11:48.77)
▶ Wilhelm van Astrea : You need not concern yourself with that. (0:11:53.40)
▶ Tivey : Hmm... Doesn't look like he's
carrying anything useful. (0:11:55.99)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : You mini guys are ransacking his corpse
like it's the obvious thing to do... (0:12:02.20)
▶ Tivey : I'm not mini. I'm Tivey. (0:12:06.79)
▶ Tivey : I think it's our right to search
out the spoils of battle. (0:12:08.96)
▶ Tivey : What is this? (0:12:15.22)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : I think it's the book that Betelgeuse
called a "Gospel." (0:12:17.80)
▶ Tivey : Eep! This is a Gospel?! (0:12:21.72)
▶ Tivey : Oh, no! I touched it! (0:12:24.27)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : I can't read it... (0:12:30.19)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : Felis, can you read this? (0:12:31.82)
▶ Felix Argyle : Whoa, nyo way! Don't point that thing at me! (0:12:33.69)
▶ Felix Argyle : And don't do something as stupid
as trying to read a Gospel! (0:12:36.24)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : Is it that dangerous? (0:12:40.53)
▶ Wilhelm van Astrea : The Gospel is the proof that one
belongs to the Witch's Cult. (0:12:44.13)
▶ Wilhelm van Astrea : They're basically their sacred texts. (0:12:47.64)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : Sacred texts? (0:12:50.67)
▶ Felix Argyle : Rumors say one is delivered to anyone
with the potential to join the cult. (0:12:51.96)
▶ Felix Argyle : And once a person gets it... Imagine that. (0:12:57.76)
▶ Felix Argyle : They're nyow a devout member
of the Witch's Cult. (0:13:00.89)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : How shady can you get? (0:13:04.81)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : Well, I guess I'll take this with me. (0:13:08.02)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : If I can decipher it, (0:13:11.27)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : maybe I can figure out what
the Witch's Cult really is. (0:13:12.27)
▶ Mimi Pearlbaton : Hey, hey, we've killed the enemy here, (0:13:16.65)
▶ Mimi Pearlbaton : so shouldn't we go make sure the
other enemies are dead, too? (0:13:20.03)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : You know, as adorable as you look, (0:13:24.45)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : you say some pretty disturbing things... (0:13:26.79)
▶ Mimi Pearlbaton : Aw, I'm adorable? You're makin' me blush! (0:13:29.67)
▶ Wilhelm van Astrea : Then the subordinates that Betelgeuse
called "fingers" number ten, in total? (0:13:33.46)
▶ Tivey : I think one of them is pinned under there. (0:13:39.31)
▶ Mimi Pearlbaton : Ten minus one is nine! (0:13:41.97)
▶ Mimi Pearlbaton : So nine are left! (0:13:43.76)
▶ Wilhelm van Astrea : Then, shall we go? (0:13:46.28)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : But they really are dead, right? (0:13:55.86)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : They won't come back the second
we look away, right? (0:13:58.49)
▶ Mimi Pearlbaton : Fine... If you're that
worried, we'll make sure. (0:14:01.78)
▶ Julius Euclius : We crushed two fingers here. (0:14:11.75)
▶ Julius Euclius : A few of the cultists were skilled,
but they posed no threat. (0:14:14.88)
▶ Julius Euclius : Driving them off, we made no error. (0:14:19.26)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : I'm glad it went well for you guys, too... (0:14:21.47)
▶ Julius Euclius : Given your demeanor, (0:14:23.76)
▶ Julius Euclius : evidently, I can assume your
news is good, as well? (0:14:25.14)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : Yep, we took out Betelgeuse! (0:14:28.06)
▶ Mimi Pearlbaton : And since this guy is such a worrywart, (0:14:31.02)
▶ Mimi Pearlbaton : we blasted him to bits with one more
"kaboom" after we killed him! (0:14:33.02)
▶ Mimi Pearlbaton : All to bits! (0:14:36.86)
▶ EXTRA : Then, that leaves the simple task of
mopping up the remnants, huh? (0:14:39.07)
▶ Ricardo : We'd better hurry (0:14:43.24)
▶ Ricardo : and take care of 'em before
my lady turns into an old granny... (0:14:44.64)
▶ Ricardo : Oh, that was my best joke, y'know! (0:14:47.91)
▶ Julius Euclius : We rendezvous soon with the dragon-drawn
carriages you arranged. (0:14:53.29)
▶ Julius Euclius : Let us eliminate the remaining fingers
and greet our victory together. (0:14:56.96)
▶ Felix Argyle : Okay, Subaru-kyun , time for the bait. (0:15:01.63)
▶ Felix Argyle : Put out that smell! (0:15:03.93)
▶ Felix Argyle : Breathe in... (0:15:05.72)
▶ Felix Argyle : And out... (0:15:07.81)
▶ Felix Argyle : And out... And out... And out... (0:15:09.14)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : Hey, hang on! Don't be crazy! (0:15:13.14)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : So I guess... (0:15:20.53)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : Once this is all done, (0:15:22.40)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : we'll go back to being friend and foe. (0:15:23.82)
▶ Julius Euclius : How confident of you to worry
about what is yet to come. (0:15:26.99)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : Hey, sue me. (0:15:29.95)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : It's going almost too well, so I
may have lowered my guard. (0:15:31.58)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : Get down! (0:15:38.09)
▶ Ricardo : What is this? (0:15:51.39)
▶ Ricardo : What's goin' on?! (0:15:52.56)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : The Unseen Hand... (0:15:54.56)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : Betelgeuse should be dead! (0:15:56.27)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : So who's— (0:15:58.37)
▶ Wilhelm van Astrea : Subaru-dono! (0:16:02.28)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : Damn it! (0:16:07.87)
▶ EXTRA : Ah! (0:16:19.00)
▶ EXTRA : My brain... trembles... (0:16:20.21)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : Who are you? (0:16:26.72)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : Wh-Who the hell are you? (0:16:31.22)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : Are you Betelgeuse's... (0:16:34.48)
▶ EXTRA : Finger, yes! (0:16:37.81)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : Let me go... (0:16:41.82)
▶ EXTRA : I am a finger, (0:16:43.52)
▶ EXTRA : one who reciprocates love. (0:16:45.59)
▶ EXTRA : A faithful, diligent
disciple who will carry out (0:16:48.52)
▶ EXTRA : the Ordeal, following the guidance of love! (0:16:52.46)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : A copy? (0:16:57.04)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : A replica of... the original Betelgeuse? (0:16:58.46)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : If so, this couldn't...
possibly get any worse. (0:17:02.42)
▶ EXTRA : Sniff, sniff. (0:17:08.09)
▶ EXTRA : The love that hangs from you does not
compare to that of a mere follower. (0:17:10.32)
▶ EXTRA : It is equal to that of a Sin Archbishop. (0:17:14.48)
▶ EXTRA : It is exceedingly (0:17:18.23)
▶ EXTRA : displeasing, dissatisfying, disagreeable,
discomforting, disproportionate, discordant! (0:17:19.56)
▶ EXTRA : But that is the proof that you are Pride! (0:17:25.44)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : Don't make me keep saying it... (0:17:30.53)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : I'm not even close to Pride. (0:17:32.70)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : I've never gotten a free book,
even as a membership perk! (0:17:34.60)
▶ EXTRA : My! Are you being stubborn? (0:17:37.96)
▶ EXTRA : Still, soon enough, you will quite readily... (0:17:41.04)
▶ EXTRA : The Gospel... (0:17:45.30)
▶ EXTRA : The guidance of my love! (0:17:47.09)
▶ EXTRA : The Gospel that allows me,
though inexperienced, to return love! (0:17:49.42)
▶ EXTRA : It isn't with me now! (0:17:53.89)
▶ EXTRA : Was it you? (0:17:59.56)
▶ EXTRA : You? You? You? You? You? You? You? You?! (0:18:02.15)
▶ EXTRA : Did you steal it?! (0:18:05.82)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : Wha... (0:18:11.57)
▶ EXTRA : A spirit? (0:18:12.16)
▶ EXTRA : A spirit! (0:18:17.12)
▶ EXTRA : Spirit! Spirit! Spirit! (0:18:19.46)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : Damn it. (0:18:27.30)
▶ EXTRA : Is that all you can do? (0:18:34.01)
▶ EXTRA : If so... (0:18:36.39)
▶ EXTRA : Be dismayed. Disappointed. Dejected. (0:18:37.43)
▶ EXTRA : Are you two slothful?! (0:18:40.02)
▶ EXTRA : My life is spilling out... (0:18:49.49)
▶ EXTRA : My blood is running dry. (0:18:51.86)
▶ EXTRA : My diligent pulse, my life's support, (0:18:54.28)
▶ EXTRA : is stopping... disappearing. (0:18:59.04)
▶ EXTRA : Ah, my brain... trembl— (0:19:02.12)
▶ Felix Argyle : The first Sloth we defeated was a double, (0:19:09.25)
▶ Felix Argyle : and this was the real one? (0:19:12.34)
▶ Julius Euclius : No, (0:19:15.05)
▶ Julius Euclius : this may not be a matter of which is real. (0:19:16.19)
▶ Wilhelm van Astrea : You mean that there may be more
than one Sin Archbishop of Sloth? (0:19:20.43)
▶ Julius Euclius : Either that... (0:19:25.31)
▶ Julius Euclius : Or all hundred followers,
including the fingers, (0:19:26.69)
▶ Julius Euclius : are the Sin Archbishop of Sloth. (0:19:29.40)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : I dragged you all into this. (0:19:32.61)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : If I'd realized it sooner, I could
have avoided this. (0:19:47.21)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : I knew what kind of power it was, so I... (0:19:51.80)
▶ Wilhelm van Astrea : Subaru-dono... (0:19:57.01)
▶ Wilhelm van Astrea : I am sure that many thoughts are running
through your mind right now. (0:19:59.93)
▶ Wilhelm van Astrea : And I am certain none are superficial. (0:20:06.34)
▶ Wilhelm van Astrea : But while this may be inelegant
of me, I must say this. (0:20:10.44)
▶ Wilhelm van Astrea : Fight! (0:20:16.99)
▶ Wilhelm van Astrea : Even if you have regrets, (0:20:19.58)
▶ Wilhelm van Astrea : even if you have remorse, you must fight. (0:20:21.45)

yourself to fight, to struggle, (0:20:23.99)

one moment, or one instant. (0:20:32.68)
▶ Wilhelm van Astrea : Cling greedily to the victory
you have within your sight. (0:20:37.61)
▶ Wilhelm van Astrea : If you can still stand,
if your fingers still move, (0:20:40.93)
▶ Wilhelm van Astrea : if all your teeth have not broken. (0:20:45.02)

▶ Subaru Natsuki : Lend me your wisdom and strength! (0:21:11.34)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : We're gonna start evacuating
the mansion and village! (0:21:16.84)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : Don't waste a single second! (0:21:19.43)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : Right now, (0:21:24.77)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : the Witch's Cult hasn't noticed yet
that the plain is wide open. (0:21:26.10)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : We can get Emilia and the others in carriages, (0:21:29.94)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : and get them to safety in plain sight. (0:21:31.90)
▶ Felix Argyle : With Emilia-sama and the others safe,
we won't have to worry about them. (0:21:35.32)
▶ Felix Argyle : So we can focus on
subjugating the Witch's Cult. (0:21:39.03)
▶ Felix Argyle : Fighting isn't easy when you know
you have a weak point! (0:21:41.74)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : You're making my ears hurt... (0:21:45.04)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : But that's exactly right. (0:21:46.66)
▶ Felix Argyle : While I'm at it, let me say one more thing. (0:21:49.79)
▶ Felix Argyle : Subaru-kyun , you should really
make up with Julius soon. (0:21:53.00)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : Soon? We already reconciled after our fight. (0:21:57.92)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : You didn't see? (0:22:01.93)
▶ Felix Argyle : That was just for starters, wasn't it? (0:22:02.93)
▶ Felix Argyle : You still subconsciously harbor resentment. (0:22:05.18)
▶ Felix Argyle : You can rely on Julius. (0:22:09.64)
▶ Felix Argyle : But I admit he is a bit unapproachable
and incomprehensible. (0:22:11.90)
▶ Felix Argyle : Go on, hurry up. (0:22:19.11)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : Okay, fine! (0:22:22.87)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : Uh... (0:22:29.12)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : So, hey, there's something
I wanted to say to you... (0:22:30.91)▶ Subaru Natsuki : What the hell's going on? (0:00:07.84)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : Is this the Witch Cult's doing? (0:00:09.52)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : Hey! Anyone? (0:00:11.94)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : Is anyone there? (0:00:13.56)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : Answer me! (0:00:15.34)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : Wh-What is that intense smell? (0:00:19.99)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : P-Patrasche! (0:00:36.29)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : No... (0:00:43.40)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : A flower like this couldn't actually exist. (0:00:44.96)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : And Patrasche wouldn't just let me die... (0:00:48.84)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : Which means... This is an illusion. (0:00:51.96)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : It's all make-believe! (0:00:55.41)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : A lesser spirit? Did you come to help me? (0:01:08.72)
▶ Julius Euclius : Subaru! (0:01:15.04)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : It was you? (0:01:17.50)
▶ Julius Euclius : That spiteful tone means it's definitely you. (0:01:19.56)
▶ Julius Euclius : I cannot imagine my subconscious (0:01:23.40)
▶ Julius Euclius : creating such a realistic imitation of you. (0:01:25.88)
▶ Julius Euclius : This is a bewitching spell. (0:01:31.86)
▶ Julius Euclius : Only you and I have returned to normal. (0:01:34.84)
▶ Julius Euclius : How did you make it back? (0:01:38.34)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : I burned a flower in my illusion. (0:01:39.95)
▶ Julius Euclius : I see. (0:01:42.36)
▶ Julius Euclius : Someone put a suggestion
on the flower's scent. (0:01:43.95)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : Hey, is that... (0:01:49.71)
▶ Julius Euclius : The glow of my little buds. (0:01:51.50)
▶ Julius Euclius : I will teach everyone how to break
out of the bewitching spell. (0:01:54.21)
▶ Julius Euclius : In... Nes. (0:01:57.63)
▶ Mimi Pearlbaton : Hi-ho! Hi-ho! No one's here! Where am I?! (0:02:06.39)
▶ Wilhelm van Astrea : I've strayed away... No,
we've been pulled apart! (0:02:11.81)
▶ Julius Euclius : Is his affinity too great? (0:02:12.82)
▶ Wilhelm van Astrea : This is bad! If I don't do something... (0:02:13.73)
▶ Julius Euclius : I'm sorry. Take a deep breath
and endure it. (0:02:15.07)
▶ Ricardo : No, this is awful! No matter how much
forest I destroy, nothin' changes! (0:02:15.82)
▶ Julius Euclius : I cannot spare the energy to
fine-tune it just for you. (0:02:18.36)
▶ Felix Argyle : For this to happen at a time
like this... Crusch-sama! (0:02:18.70)
▶ Julius Euclius : Bringing everyone back is our priority. (0:02:21.74)
▶ Wilhelm van Astrea : That will be quite enough. (0:02:38.22)
▶ Ram : Kill me. (0:02:44.85)
▶ Ram : I won't accept this disgrace. (0:02:46.22)
▶ Ram : And? What is the meaning of all this? (0:04:20.60)
▶ Ram : Barusu, you'll explain it to me, right? (0:04:23.31)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : That's what I'd like to ask you. (0:04:25.79)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : You're the one who attacked us first. (0:04:28.10)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : What were you thinking? (0:04:31.11)
▶ Ram : You shouldn't have to
ask what I was thinking. (0:04:32.78)
▶ Ram : It's rich, coming from an ingrate like you. (0:04:35.24)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : Ingrate? (0:04:37.86)
▶ Ram : You are, aren't you? (0:04:39.09)
▶ Ram : After everything Roswaal-sama did for you... (0:04:40.75)
▶ Ram : Once you're done with him, you'd rush
to wag your tail for another master. (0:04:44.17)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : Hang on! I think you're
mixing up your stories! (0:04:47.64)
▶ Ram : So this is what it means to bite
the hand that feeds you. (0:04:50.89)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : Listen to me... The handwritten letter! (0:04:54.07)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : I wrote you a letter about this! (0:04:56.19)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : Wasn't it delivered to the mansion? (0:04:58.44)
▶ Ram : Yes, I did get a letter from the capital, (0:05:00.36)
▶ Ram : but... (0:05:03.03)
▶ Ram : It was quite amusing,
sending me a blank letter. (0:05:04.40)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : A blank letter? (0:05:08.45)
▶ Julius Euclius : To send a blank letter (0:05:10.70)
▶ Julius Euclius : is a metaphor that means you have (0:05:12.98)
▶ Julius Euclius : no intention of speaking to the recipient. (0:05:15.08)
▶ Julius Euclius : It could easily be interpreted
as a declaration of war. (0:05:18.08)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : This is a huge misunderstanding! (0:05:21.55)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : Do I even look that clever to you? (0:05:23.34)
▶ Ram : So this is what it means to bite
the hand that feeds you. (0:05:26.18)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : You're still saying that? (0:05:29.22)
▶ Ram : I can't say it enough. (0:05:30.68)
▶ Ram : But I get the gist now. (0:05:32.56)
▶ Ram : The blank letter was some kind of mistake, (0:05:35.06)
▶ Ram : and you are still Emilia-sama's dog. (0:05:37.52)
▶ Ram : Correct? (0:05:40.10)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : Not really, but... (0:05:41.07)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : Okay, sure. Dogs are like family, anyway. (0:05:42.73)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : I'm fine as a dog if I belong to Emilia. (0:05:46.32)
▶ Wilhelm van Astrea : Would you not say that standard is a bit low? (0:05:49.37)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : In any case, these guys are reinforcements. (0:05:53.37)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : They're friends. (0:05:55.58)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : We pulled them together to
wipe out the Witch's Cult. (0:05:56.83)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : There's no time. (0:06:00.96)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : We need to start by evacuating the villagers. (0:06:02.17)
▶ Julius Euclius : Subaru, they seem rather uneasy. (0:06:12.93)
▶ Julius Euclius : Remember to be considerate. (0:06:17.02)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : Okay, attention! (0:06:20.19)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : I haven't seen you guys in a while. (0:06:22.48)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : How have you been? (0:06:24.11)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : Look, I know this is sudden, (0:06:25.94)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : but I need to ask you all a favor! (0:06:27.65)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : It seems mabeasts are up to no
good in the nearby forest again. (0:06:29.99)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : So I've brought some specialists
to exterminate them... (0:06:34.54)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : But while they're working, (0:06:39.29)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : I'd like you all to leave the village. (0:06:40.96)
▶ EXTRA : Don't try to fool us! (0:06:43.04)
▶ EXTRA : You're trying to sound cheerful about this,
but the villagers are frightened! (0:06:45.63)
▶ EXTRA : All along, we've been afraid the
Witch's Cult would try something! (0:06:50.55)
▶ EXTRA : The Witch's Cult? No one told me about that. (0:06:53.55)
▶ EXTRA : Hey, wait... (0:06:55.93)
▶ EXTRA : Seriously? (0:06:56.72)
▶ EXTRA : Why lie about that? (0:06:57.10)
▶ EXTRA : Maybe he's trying to hide something. (0:06:58.27)
▶ EXTRA : You don't deny it, then? (0:07:02.35)
▶ EXTRA : Then, it was true! (0:07:05.32)
▶ EXTRA : Why would they bother a
remote village like this? (0:07:07.57)
▶ EXTRA : Why else? Because of that half-elf! (0:07:09.49)
▶ EXTRA : Because this domain's lord is endorsing
that half-elf for ruler! (0:07:12.41)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : Why do you have to make it about that? (0:07:17.12)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : The half-elf thing... (0:07:19.71)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : Emilia has nothing to do with it! (0:07:21.67)
▶ EXTRA : She has everything to do with it! (0:07:23.61)
▶ EXTRA : If you mess with a half-elf,
the Witch's Cult shows up. (0:07:25.54)
▶ EXTRA : Even the village children know that! (0:07:28.71)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : You guys seriously believe that? (0:07:32.51)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : That it's the fault of the half-elf
in the mansion?! (0:07:36.18)
▶ Emilia : The village, huh? (0:07:43.35)
▶ Emilia : But it might cause trouble for you. (0:07:44.48)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : Does that mean I'm just being selfish again? (0:07:51.03)
▶ Felix Argyle : "Lift your head. Don't look down." (0:07:59.87)
▶ Felix Argyle : That's what Crusch-sama would say. (0:08:02.71)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : You... (0:08:05.00)
▶ Felix Argyle : Do you think what you're doing is wrong? (0:08:06.71)
▶ Felix Argyle : If not, there's no reason to look down. (0:08:09.55)
▶ Felix Argyle : Or is it harder to lift your head here (0:08:12.76)
▶ Felix Argyle : than to throw a tantrum in the castle? (0:08:15.14)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : Now, listen... (0:08:18.14)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : You're right. (0:08:20.60)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : Compared to that, this is nothing! (0:08:22.27)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : I understand your feelings and
concerns very well! (0:08:26.73)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : I won't tell you to try to change them now. (0:08:29.86)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : Obviously, you'll have your own opinions. (0:08:33.20)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : It hurts, but I understand. (0:08:35.74)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : But for now, please accept my request. (0:08:39.54)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : Please do as I say! (0:08:42.12)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : Staying in the village is dangerous. (0:08:43.79)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : That's the truth! (0:08:46.13)
▶ Ram : The words of my household's employee (0:08:49.84)
▶ Ram : are those of our master,
Roswaal-sama, himself. (0:08:52.13)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : Ram... (0:08:55.22)
▶ Ram : Follow his instructions immediately. (0:08:56.76)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : You saved me back there. Thanks. (0:09:03.77)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : But... (0:09:06.90)
▶ Ram : What? (0:09:07.60)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : Having you take my side so easily
is kind of a new feeling. (0:09:08.69)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : Does that mean you've acknowledged me? (0:09:12.86)
▶ EXTRA : Subaru! (0:09:16.74)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : Hey, Petra... What's up? (0:09:18.57)
▶ EXTRA : U-Um, will the lady from the
mansion run away with us? (0:09:21.16)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : Huh? (0:09:26.00)
▶ EXTRA : She came to the village yesterday. (0:09:27.25)
▶ EXTRA : She told us (0:09:31.00)
▶ EXTRA : we should take refuge in the mansion because (0:09:32.05)
▶ EXTRA : it's dangerous here, just like you said. (0:09:34.86)
▶ EXTRA : But no one in the village
would listen to her. (0:09:38.09)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : It's okay. (0:09:42.81)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : She wouldn't get mad or anything. (0:09:44.77)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : Anyway, you should hurry and run. (0:09:47.27)
▶ EXTRA : Okay! (0:09:48.90)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : What happened to Emilia after that? (0:09:53.61)
▶ Ram : You should know that she isn't
so perceptive as to back down (0:09:55.69)
▶ Ram : the moment someone denies her. (0:09:59.32)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : But I also know she's not the kind of girl
who wouldn't be hurt by mean words. (0:10:01.41)
▶ Ram : She tried to convince the villagers
to leave, but they refused. (0:10:07.50)
▶ Ram : But she couldn't do nothing, (0:10:10.42)
▶ Ram : so she repaired the forest barrier. (0:10:12.67)
▶ Ram : She feared there might be a mabeast attack. (0:10:16.26)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : In and of itself, that's not a
bad decision, but still... (0:10:19.13)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : Julius... (0:10:25.14)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : Come with me. (0:10:27.43)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : I'm going to explain things to Emilia
and the loli in the mansion. (0:10:28.94)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : With you there, it'll be more convincing. (0:10:32.40)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : Just take it as a sign of my repentance
for going nuts in the castle. (0:10:37.07)
▶ Julius Euclius : I see. Understood. (0:10:42.20)
▶ Julius Euclius : If that will help the discussion
to go more smoothly, (0:10:44.58)
▶ Julius Euclius : do not hesitate to use me. (0:10:47.45)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : Also... (0:10:49.87)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : You were the one who put a
spirit on me, weren't you? (0:10:51.92)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : Explain that. (0:10:55.50)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : I get that you're a spirit arts user. (0:10:57.51)
▶ Julius Euclius : More precisely, I prefer to
be called a "spirit knight." (0:11:00.97)
▶ Julius Euclius : I do use the spirit arts, of course. (0:11:04.26)
▶ Julius Euclius : But that has not prevented me
from training with the sword. (0:11:06.85)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : And you were the one who set
the little red one on me? (0:11:11.40)
▶ Julius Euclius : "Set it on you" is a harsh way to put it. (0:11:15.02)
▶ Julius Euclius : I was only having her,
Ia, secretly protect you. (0:11:17.69)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : By the way, what was that thing you
did when you broke the illusion? (0:11:22.24)
▶ Julius Euclius : A high class of magic known as "Nect." (0:11:26.74)
▶ Julius Euclius : It connects the gates
of all who are in range, (0:11:29.75)
▶ Julius Euclius : so they can communicate with each other. (0:11:32.42)
▶ Julius Euclius : However, it appeared to work
a bit too well on you. (0:11:35.09)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : I thought I was about to lose myself. (0:11:38.19)
▶ Julius Euclius : For the spirits to mistake
the tuning is unusual. (0:11:41.22)
▶ Julius Euclius : You may have a strong affinity
with spirits, perhaps. (0:11:44.60)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : Sadly, the only spirit I ever made
friends with was a gray cat. (0:11:50.23)
▶ Felix Argyle : Well? Did you patch things up with Julius? (0:11:57.36)
▶ Felix Argyle : Did it work out? (0:12:00.53)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : I'm taking that matter back with me, (0:12:01.45)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : to mull over carefully before I
make an optimistic decision. (0:12:03.16)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : Come to the mansion with me. (0:12:07.03)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : I'll need at least one person from
the Crusch camp with me, (0:12:09.45)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : to smooth over the misunderstanding
with the letter. (0:12:12.29)
▶ Felix Argyle : I'll do that after I finish my work here. (0:12:15.71)
▶ Felix Argyle : Subaru-kyun , come help us, too. (0:12:18.88)
▶ Felix Argyle : It's dangerous work
involving the Witch's Cult. (0:12:20.80)
▶ Felix Argyle : The contract said he'd buy their
cargo at the asking price, (0:12:23.51)
▶ Felix Argyle : so we must thoroughly inspect the goods. (0:12:26.30)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : Huh? But that shouldn't be our job. (0:12:28.85)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : Isn't this more importa— (0:12:32.35)

in my carriage! (0:12:34.73)

▶ Felix Argyle : There. He lowered his guard. (0:12:46.95)
▶ Felix Argyle : This guy's one of the Witch's Cult. (0:12:53.41)
▶ Felix Argyle : I touched him earlier to confirm it. (0:12:55.62)
▶ Felix Argyle : A weird spell is implanted in him, (0:12:57.88)
▶ Felix Argyle : just like the "fingers"
of the Sin Archbishops. (0:13:00.05)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : One was among the merchants? (0:13:02.21)
▶ Felix Argyle : That's why I stole into his carriage,
to get under his guard. (0:13:04.47)
▶ Felix Argyle : Now, tell us all the details concerning
what you're plotting. (0:13:08.97)
▶ Felix Argyle : My hands are the gentlest in the world, (0:13:13.56)
▶ Felix Argyle : but they can do some nasty things, too. (0:13:16.50)
▶ EXTRA : That's... (0:13:18.90)

▶ EXTRA : ...right. (0:13:22.94)

▶ Felix Argyle : I had no choice. (0:13:46.89)
▶ Felix Argyle : I can't reproduce clothes with healing magic. (0:13:48.43)

▶ EXTRA : Run 'em off! Don't back down! (0:13:56.28)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : How did they get into the village? (0:14:02.49)
▶ Felix Argyle : They stowed away in the carriages. (0:14:04.87)
▶ Felix Argyle : There was a finger among the merchants, (0:14:07.29)
▶ Felix Argyle : and we didn't take care of him. (0:14:09.20)
▶ Felix Argyle : I failed. (0:14:10.96)
▶ Julius Euclius : This is not the time for regrets. (0:14:12.62)
▶ Julius Euclius : We had Tivey and Madame Ram evacuate
to the mansion with the injured. (0:14:14.92)
▶ Julius Euclius : Felis, join them and heal who you can. (0:14:19.14)

▶ Julius Euclius : The moment Ia was flung from his
body, I had a bad feeling... (0:21:34.11)
▶ Felix Argyle : What do you mean? (0:21:38.65)
▶ Julius Euclius : That (0:21:39.86)
▶ Julius Euclius : isn't Subaru. (0:21:41.37)

▶ Julius Euclius : Get out of that body right now! (0:22:05.20)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : Madman? (0:22:07.93)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : That's right. I am driven mad with love. (0:22:09.18)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : Generous love, respectful love, pure love, (0:22:14.02)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : tender love, familial love,
erotic love, friendly love! (0:22:16.34)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : Love, love, love... Love! Love! Love! Love! (0:22:19.04)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : Love! (0:22:22.66)
▶ Julius Euclius : Subaru! Wake up! (0:22:27.75)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : It's no use. (0:22:29.96)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : This body is already under
my subconscious control. (0:22:31.58)
▶ Julius Euclius : Realize what you're about to do, Subaru... (0:22:36.16)
▶ Julius Euclius : Remember what you returned here to do! (0:22:39.88)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : What? (0:22:43.01)

▶ Subaru Natsuki : If you don't stop me now, we can't win. (0:23:06.58)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : Before that happens... (0:23:11.35)
▶ Julius Euclius : No, Subaru! I cannot do that! (0:23:13.09)
▶ Julius Euclius : You told me, "It can wait." (0:23:15.64)
▶ Julius Euclius : Wasn't there something
you meant to tell me? (0:23:17.94)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : Sorry... It looks like
I won't get the chance. (0:23:20.75)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : Felis! (0:23:24.68)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : Please. (0:23:28.49)

▶ Felix Argyle : I will, too. (0:23:38.44)
▶ Julius Euclius : Felis! (0:23:48.25)
▶ Felix Argyle : No one else can do it, can they? (0:23:48.99)
▶ Felix Argyle : This is what Subaru-kyun wants! (0:23:51.46)
▶ Julius Euclius : But still... (0:23:55.15)
▶ Felix Argyle : You think I did that
because I wanted to? (0:23:56.11)
▶ Felix Argyle : To use my power for Crusch-sama, (0:23:58.58)
▶ Felix Argyle : the power I swore to our leader, for this?! (0:24:00.48)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : Ah, it can't be, it can't be... (0:24:02.94)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : Just when I'd found such a perfect vessel... (0:24:06.78)
▶ Julius Euclius : My lack of virtue was what forced this
undesirable decision on you and Felis. (0:24:09.99)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : Just when the Ordeal's completion
was at hand... (0:24:11.12)
▶ Julius Euclius : One day, I'm sure I will be punished. (0:24:15.53)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : I will never die... (0:24:19.18)▶ Ricardo : Boy? (0:00:05.72)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : This can't be... (0:00:07.67)
▶ Ricardo : What's wrong? (0:00:10.86)
▶ Felix Argyle : You were spaced out, so I had to pick on you. (0:00:19.90)
▶ Felix Argyle : Nyow that was a satisfying reaction! (0:00:21.81)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : Felis? (0:00:23.96)
▶ Felix Argyle : Who else do I look like? (0:00:25.17)
▶ Felix Argyle : Did you inhale too much of
the White Whale's fog? (0:00:26.74)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : Uh, no... I'm fine. (0:00:29.96)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : That told me what I wanted to know. (0:00:32.06)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : That means... (0:00:35.37)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : My save point was updated? (0:00:36.79)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : There are a few new things (0:00:45.45)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : I've realized about the Witch's Cult. (0:00:48.16)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : Does anyone know of, like... (0:00:51.37)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : a power you can use to overwrite
someone's consciousness, (0:00:53.77)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : so you psychologically possess them? (0:00:57.25)
▶ Julius Euclius : In other words, (0:01:00.34)
▶ Julius Euclius : you think the Sin Archbishops
may have such an ability? (0:01:01.28)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : Yeah, I call it "possession." (0:01:06.79)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : It's how he stays alive. (0:01:10.28)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : It would explain how he keeps
popping up everywhere, right? (0:01:12.74)
▶ Julius Euclius : In an old book, I saw a research
account of a similar subject. (0:01:16.69)
▶ Julius Euclius : It's a magic that has been lost, (0:01:21.22)
▶ Julius Euclius : but the technique only works
under certain conditions. (0:01:23.27)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : Conditions? (0:01:26.71)
▶ Julius Euclius : Only members of the Witch's Cult, (0:01:28.28)
▶ Julius Euclius : and only a limited number of those, (0:01:30.11)
▶ Julius Euclius : are thought capable of it. (0:01:33.50)
▶ Felix Argyle : And those would be the fingers? (0:01:35.29)
▶ Julius Euclius : Most likely, they are the user's spare bodies. (0:01:37.62)
▶ Julius Euclius : It's quite a tasteless arrangement. (0:01:40.71)
▶ Julius Euclius : I suppose one might call it
worthy of a Sin Archbishop. (0:01:42.66)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : So if the Sin Archbishop's confidants, (0:01:45.86)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : the fingers, were wiped out... (0:01:47.91)
▶ Julius Euclius : If that happened, (0:01:51.44)
▶ Julius Euclius : his soul would have nowhere to go. (0:01:53.05)
▶ Julius Euclius : And that would be the end of him. (0:01:56.08)
▶ Julius Euclius : We should first eliminate the
fingers in the forest, (0:01:59.96)
▶ Julius Euclius : and then face Sloth directly. (0:02:02.92)
▶ Julius Euclius : That is my conclusion. (0:02:04.88)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : Guys, I need to say one more thing... (0:02:09.46)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : Sorry, but I don't think
it's only the fingers. (0:02:14.26)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : I think he may be able to possess me, too... (0:02:18.06)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : What do you think I should do? (0:02:21.44)
▶ Ricardo : Huh? (0:02:24.91)
▶ Bordeaux : Filthy woman! (0:02:27.68)
▶ Priscilla Barielle : Then, will you also apologize for being born? (0:02:28.95)
▶ Priscilla Barielle : You silver-haired half-elf. (0:02:30.54)
▶ Priscilla Barielle : Margrave Mathers endorses
a half-devil? Utter foolishness! (0:02:31.81)
▶ Rickert : This is a joke! (0:02:33.01)
Priscilla Barielle : Then, will you also apologize for being born? (0:02:33.01b)
▶ Emilia : You know, I had hopes for you. (0:02:36.17)
▶ Bordeaux : Filthy woman! (0:02:37.13)
▶ Emilia : I thought maybe you... (0:02:38.50)
▶ Emilia : That only you wouldn't give
me special treatment. (0:02:40.73)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : I can't do that. (0:02:42.82)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : I can't look at you the way I look at others. (0:02:44.94)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : It's impossible. (0:02:49.74)
▶ Emilia : I have no connection to the witch... (0:02:53.00)
▶ Priscilla Barielle : You silver-haired half-elf. (0:02:53.96)
▶ Bordeaux : Margrave Mathers endorses a half-devil? (0:02:54.35)
▶ Puck : Lia... (0:03:05.59)
▶ Puck : Your forehead is all wrinkled. (0:03:06.76)
▶ Emilia : Good morning, Puck. (0:03:11.18)
▶ Emilia : You're early today. (0:03:12.74)
▶ Puck : Morning, Lia. (0:03:14.40)
▶ Puck : I thought I'd try going to sleep
and waking up earlier. (0:03:15.65)
▶ Puck : That's a lie. (0:03:19.41)
▶ Puck : The truth is that I was worried about you. (0:03:21.27)
▶ Puck : You've had it rough lately. (0:03:24.81)
▶ Puck : Especially yesterday... (0:03:26.82)
▶ Emilia : It was nothing I didn't know already. (0:03:34.52)
▶ Puck : Even if you know you'll fall, (0:03:37.50)
▶ Puck : when it happens, you still hurt and bleed. (0:03:39.56)
▶ Emilia : What do you think I should do, Puck? (0:03:46.65)
▶ Emilia : No, not just me... (0:03:49.78)
▶ Emilia : How can I be better to everyone,
and have them be better to me? (0:03:52.45)
▶ Puck : I think you should do what you want. (0:03:59.83)
▶ Puck : I'll be on your side, no matter what you do. (0:04:02.48)
▶ Puck : And no matter what, (0:04:07.82)
▶ Puck : you can't abandon that village, right? (0:04:09.45)
▶ Puck : Early this morning,
Ram headed out there again. (0:04:12.71)
▶ Puck : Maybe we should wait to hear from her. (0:04:16.28)
▶ Puck : I'm going to check on Betty. (0:04:23.75)
▶ Emilia : Oh... Okay. (0:04:26.47)
▶ Emilia : Tell her hello for me. (0:04:28.47)
▶ Emilia : Ram? (0:04:33.77)
▶ Ram : Emilia-sama, you have a visitor. (0:04:35.09)
▶ Emilia : You are... (0:04:39.52)
▶ Emilia : from Crusch-sama's household, aren't you? (0:04:41.22)
▶ Wilhelm van Astrea : I am Wilhelm Trias. (0:04:45.43)
▶ Wilhelm van Astrea : I have come on my master's behalf. (0:04:48.13)
▶ Emilia : On Crusch-sama's behalf? (0:04:51.56)
▶ Emilia : I received a blank letter
from her yesterday... (0:04:53.25)
▶ Wilhelm van Astrea : I see, so it was true. (0:04:56.57)
▶ Wilhelm van Astrea : While this shames me to say, (0:04:59.41)
▶ Wilhelm van Astrea : the letter contradicted the message
my master wished to send. (0:05:01.65)
▶ Emilia : Oh... It was a mistake, then? (0:05:06.02)
▶ Wilhelm van Astrea : Yes, Emilia-sama and Ram-dono... (0:05:08.51)
▶ Wilhelm van Astrea : We would like to evacuate those remaining (0:05:12.69)
▶ Wilhelm van Astrea : in the mansion, along with the villagers. (0:05:14.87)
▶ Wilhelm van Astrea : That is Crusch-sama's will. (0:05:18.00)
▶ Emilia : What? (0:05:20.15)
▶ Emilia : There's a ring of criminals near the forest? (0:05:21.39)
▶ Ram : Yes. (0:05:24.53)
▶ Ram : The punitive force this messenger brought (0:05:25.80)
▶ Ram : already prepares to fight the enemy. (0:05:28.91)
▶ Emilia : But why would Crusch-sama do
so much to help this domain? (0:05:31.64)
▶ Wilhelm van Astrea : The margrave sent my master a proposal (0:05:36.82)
▶ Wilhelm van Astrea : for an alliance with respect
to the royal selection. (0:05:40.65)
▶ Wilhelm van Astrea : The condition is a share of the
mining rights in Elior Forest. (0:05:43.77)
▶ Wilhelm van Astrea : Do you understand? (0:05:48.35)
▶ Emilia : So that's what this is about. (0:05:51.72)
▶ Wilhelm van Astrea : But evacuating all the villagers
to the capital will be difficult. (0:05:53.94)
▶ Wilhelm van Astrea : Half of them will go to the capital. (0:05:58.94)
▶ Ram : I will lead the other half to
safety in the Sanctuary. (0:06:02.06)
▶ Ram : Roswaal-sama is heading there now. (0:06:06.33)
▶ Emilia : O-Oh, I see... (0:06:09.30)
▶ Emilia : Then, discussion on the
matter is already over. (0:06:11.70)
▶ Emilia : But isn't there something strange about this? (0:06:16.68)
▶ Emilia : It all seems too well-timed— (0:06:19.26)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : Pardon me. (0:06:22.92)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : The group hiding in the forest has
been observed moving strangely. (0:06:24.81)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : We haven't a moment to waste! (0:06:28.58)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : Once they make their move, the entire
region will be a sea of blood! (0:06:30.78)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : What will it be, Captain? (0:06:34.24)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : No, Sword Demon Wilhelm-dono? (0:06:36.30)
▶ Wilhelm van Astrea : Emilia-sama? (0:06:39.88)
▶ Emilia : I understand. (0:06:45.80)
▶ Emilia : I gratefully accept your kindness. (0:06:47.35)
▶ Emilia : Has this been explained to the villagers? (0:06:50.82)
▶ Ram : They have been informed in a
timely fashion, Emilia-sama. (0:06:52.95)
▶ Emilia : I see... (0:06:57.09)
▶ Puck : Betty says she'll stay here. (0:06:58.71)
▶ Emilia : Puck! (0:07:00.50)
▶ Beatrice : Betty can't go. (0:07:02.76)
▶ Beatrice : I'll wait for your return, I suppose. (0:07:04.89)
▶ Beatrice : You don't have to worry. (0:07:07.42)
▶ Puck : That's what she said. (0:07:11.38)
▶ Puck : Well, in Betty's case, (0:07:12.52)
▶ Puck : the forbidden library is a much safer place. (0:07:13.85)
▶ Puck : Besides, due to her contract,
she can't leave the mansion. (0:07:16.65)
▶ Puck : Lia, you know that, right? (0:07:20.81)
▶ Emilia : No fair using that as a reason... (0:07:22.92)
▶ Puck : So, since my cute little sister
will be staying here, (0:07:25.96)
▶ Puck : we shouldn't do anything to the mansion. (0:07:29.53)
▶ Puck : Betty is sweet and kind, (0:07:31.71)
▶ Puck : but she'll show no mercy. (0:07:33.95)
▶ Wilhelm van Astrea : Understood, Great Spirit. (0:07:35.82)
▶ Puck : You should do what you want. (0:07:42.58)
▶ Puck : I'm on your side, and yours alone. (0:07:45.24)
▶ Emilia : We will evacuate. (0:07:52.26)
▶ Emilia : I don't want to endanger the villagers! (0:07:54.25)
▶ EXTRA : We're ready, miss. (0:08:05.72)
▶ Emilia : Um, I think there's been some kind of mistake. (0:08:09.84)
▶ Ram : No, given the number of people and carriages, (0:08:13.94)
▶ Ram : we must ask you to ride with these children. (0:08:17.01)
▶ Ram : It's a necessary measure. (0:08:21.01)
▶ Emilia : Can't we put them in a different carriage? (0:08:23.20)
▶ Emilia : That would be better for the children— (0:08:25.48)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : You think no one would want to ride with you? (0:08:27.21)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : Have you asked the kids how
they feel about that? (0:08:31.72)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : Perhaps you just assume (0:08:35.57)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : that they hate you and wouldn't
want to be around you? (0:08:37.51)
▶ Emilia : That isn't... (0:08:42.38)
▶ Emilia : I don't need to ask them. (0:08:44.49)
▶ Emilia : I know it's best for everyone. (0:08:46.75)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : Six children and one dragon-drawn carriage. (0:08:48.39)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : If we stumble here, (0:08:51.65)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : how will your wish ever come true? (0:08:53.66)
▶ Emilia : A-Are you... (0:08:56.98)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : What do you think, Petra? (0:08:59.84)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : Do you refuse to ride in the
same carriage as she does? (0:09:01.45)
▶ EXTRA : Of course not. (0:09:08.53)
▶ EXTRA : Aren't you the lady with the potato stamps? (0:09:11.13)
▶ EXTRA : The one who came with Subaru to
watch our radio calisthenics! (0:09:14.49)
▶ Emilia : Well... (0:09:19.50)

time talking with Subaru! (0:09:23.27)

▶ Emilia : Where did he go? (0:10:02.84)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : Now, I get it... (0:10:14.42)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : We couldn't figure out how
you guys stayed in touch. (0:10:15.88)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : Those metia sure are handy, huh? (0:10:18.78)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : You owe a heavy price for
the crime of interrupting (0:10:23.81)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : my touching reunion with Emilia! (0:10:26.97)
▶ EXTRA : You're... (0:10:29.45)
▶ Wilhelm van Astrea : Too slow. (0:10:32.98)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : In short, we knew you were a spy. (0:10:38.74)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : How we learned is a trade secret. (0:10:42.55)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : So we set a trap for you, (0:10:44.68)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : the contact for the Witch's Cult. (0:10:47.90)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : Two hours. (0:10:51.92)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : You gave your buddies a schedule
that was two hours behind. (0:10:53.64)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : We'll use the time to get Emilia
and the others away, (0:10:57.67)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : crush the fingers that know our location, (0:11:00.91)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : and make preparations to
crush your Sin Archbishop. (0:11:04.49)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : Having your enemy a step ahead,
ready to destroy you... (0:11:09.46)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : You're about to learn just
how terrifying that is. (0:11:12.65)
▶ Emilia : May the blessing of the spirits be with you. (0:11:21.14)
▶ Wilhelm van Astrea : Good luck. (0:11:32.38)
▶ Felix Argyle : This is what enabled you to trick
Emilia-sama and chase her off? (0:11:35.57)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : Don't put it that way... (0:11:40.05)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : Even if it's accurate, it makes me sound bad! (0:11:41.86)
▶ Julius Euclius : That robe was woven with quite an odd spell. (0:11:44.25)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : It was handmade by Roswaal. (0:11:47.95)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : Apparently, a spell is woven into
it that prevents recognition. (0:11:50.24)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : Originally, it was Emilia's... (0:11:53.55)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : I didn't steal it, okay? (0:11:58.19)
▶ Felix Argyle : Hmm... (0:11:59.93)

with the blank letter worked out! (0:12:01.95)

mistake... It was my fault"? (0:12:13.69)
▶ Felix Argyle : And you worked so hard to convince
the villagers, Subaru-kyun ... (0:12:18.68)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : Please! (0:12:24.11)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : Emilia's... She's a girl who will
be friends with all of you, (0:12:25.37)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : so I want you to give her the
chance to convince you! (0:12:29.03)

▶ Subaru Natsuki : but please let us protect you long
enough that you get that chance! (0:12:37.79)
▶ EXTRA : Jeez, you really are hopeless, Subaru-sama. (0:12:46.57)

on the ones our location was leaked to. (0:13:25.04)
▶ Ricardo : If I messed up, I'll retire. (0:13:28.17)
▶ Ricardo : The map did a nice job showin' the way. (0:13:30.64)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : Then the mark on the map
really was their base! (0:13:32.52)
▶ Ricardo : I dunno if you'd call 'em fastidious or
high-strung, but it worked against 'em. (0:13:37.20)
▶ Ricardo : And we got what we were after. (0:13:42.26)
▶ Ricardo : This should shut down their
communications network. (0:13:44.24)
▶ Mimi Pearlbaton : Hooray! We killed 'em all! (0:13:48.33)
▶ Tivey : Don't say that. It makes us sound awful. (0:13:50.37)
▶ Tivey : We took a prisoner, too! (0:13:53.13)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : A prisoner? (0:13:55.98)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : He isn't in the Witch's Cult... (0:14:01.56)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : I wondered why you hadn't
shown up. You were caught? (0:14:04.26)

Cult, representing Sloth... (0:14:55.04)
▶ Petelgeuse Romanee-Conti : Betelgeuse Romanée-Conti! (0:14:59.48)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : Pleasure to meet you, great Sin Archbishop. (0:15:04.89)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : If you could find it within you to add my
body and soul to your fingers' ranks, (0:15:08.18)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : carrying out the Ordeal, there would
be no greater honor. (0:15:12.88)
▶ Petelgeuse Romanee-Conti : How wondrous, how vivacious your faith is! (0:15:18.79)
▶ Petelgeuse Romanee-Conti : To think there was such a devout believer. (0:15:24.91)
▶ Petelgeuse Romanee-Conti : Please forgive my sloth,
for failing to find him. (0:15:27.09)

Forgive me! Forgive me! (0:15:29.37)

▶ Petelgeuse Romanee-Conti : Ah... But, but, but... (0:15:36.03)
▶ Petelgeuse Romanee-Conti : I have no way to atone for my sloth
and foolishness but by punishment. (0:15:39.01)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : That's not true. (0:15:44.85)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : The witch wouldn't want to see
her beloved believer in pain. (0:15:47.05)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : She would be happier to see
you carry out the Ordeal! (0:15:50.56)
▶ Petelgeuse Romanee-Conti : You are exactly right... (0:15:54.78)
▶ Petelgeuse Romanee-Conti : Yes, the Ordeal. (0:15:57.72)
▶ Petelgeuse Romanee-Conti : What she needs from me now is the Ordeal! (0:15:59.25)
▶ Petelgeuse Romanee-Conti : Your words have opened my eyes. (0:16:03.44)
▶ Petelgeuse Romanee-Conti : Thank you! Thank you! (0:16:06.04)
▶ Petelgeuse Romanee-Conti : With this Ordeal, we must test her... (0:16:08.29)
▶ Petelgeuse Romanee-Conti : To learn if this half-devil
is a worthy vessel, (0:16:11.79)
▶ Petelgeuse Romanee-Conti : if she is worthy to put the witch into. (0:16:14.59)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : Put the witch into? Vessel? (0:16:18.48)
▶ Petelgeuse Romanee-Conti : If she is, the witch will possess her.
If not, reject her. (0:16:21.68)
▶ Petelgeuse Romanee-Conti : If she proves an unworthy
vessel for the witch, (0:16:25.39)
▶ Petelgeuse Romanee-Conti : then the witch will be reborn into this
world on the coming fated day... (0:16:28.45)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : You're saying Emilia is secondary,
without intrinsic value, to you? (0:16:34.21)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : You monster... (0:16:41.40)
▶ Petelgeuse Romanee-Conti : The words inscribed in the
Gospel tell of her love. (0:16:43.76)
▶ Petelgeuse Romanee-Conti : All of it guides my path! (0:16:47.49)
▶ Petelgeuse Romanee-Conti : Show me your Gospel. (0:16:50.46)
▶ Petelgeuse Romanee-Conti : What is that? (0:16:55.53)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : Just what it looks like. A metia, Archbishop. (0:16:56.96)
▶ Felix Argyle : Oh, I see him! I see him! (0:17:01.65)

▶ Subaru Natsuki : Our surprise attack is a success! (0:17:21.58)
▶ Petelgeuse Romanee-Conti : What? Surprise attack... Surprise attack... (0:17:23.92)
▶ Petelgeuse Romanee-Conti : Then, what do you think of this?! (0:17:29.12)
▶ Petelgeuse Romanee-Conti : How? How can you see my Authority? (0:17:34.54)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : Who knows? (0:17:39.25)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : Ask the witch that left her scent all over me. (0:17:40.41)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : Oh, that's right. (0:17:44.53)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : Unlike me, you haven't received the pass
that lets you meet the witch anytime. (0:17:45.59)
▶ Petelgeuse Romanee-Conti : What do you mean? (0:17:51.66)
▶ Petelgeuse Romanee-Conti : How dare you speak as though you
are intimate with the witch? (0:17:53.42)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : We're so close, she's grabbed my heart. (0:17:56.91)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : Literally... (0:17:59.82)
▶ Petelgeuse Romanee-Conti : I-Inconceivable! (0:18:01.20)
▶ Petelgeuse Romanee-Conti : That cannot be! (0:18:04.54)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : Let's go, Patrasche! (0:18:07.64)
▶ Petelgeuse Romanee-Conti : Do not presume you can escape. (0:18:15.54)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : Here he comes, here he comes, here he comes! (0:18:19.49)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : He's coming, he's coming, he's coming! (0:18:20.68)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : Keep it up, Patrasche! (0:18:22.16)
▶ Petelgeuse Romanee-Conti : Futile! Impossible! (0:18:25.44)
▶ Petelgeuse Romanee-Conti : Vanish in the face of my diligence! (0:18:26.98)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : Sorry to always rely on you... (0:18:34.39)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : You're the best, Patrasche! (0:18:36.44)
▶ Petelgeuse Romanee-Conti : But... But, but, but... (0:18:38.54)
▶ Petelgeuse Romanee-Conti : But! (0:18:40.38)
▶ Petelgeuse Romanee-Conti : This is the end, the end! (0:18:41.87)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : You guys... (0:18:49.68)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : You almost caught me in that! (0:18:51.02)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : Thanks, though. I thought I was a goner. (0:18:53.40)
▶ Mimi Pearlbaton : You're welcome! Yay! (0:18:55.69)
▶ Tivey : Is that man in the sky the Sin Archbishop? (0:18:57.72)
▶ Mimi Pearlbaton : Yikes! What the heck is that?! (0:19:01.89)
▶ Mimi Pearlbaton : There's a man flying, all balled up! Wow! (0:19:04.01)
▶ Tivey : I've never seen anything so creepy in flight. (0:19:06.75)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : That's how it looks to you guys? (0:19:09.52)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : Either way, leave him to me. (0:19:12.56)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : Watch the rear, like we planned! (0:19:14.70)
▶ Tivey : Got it! You heard him, Sis! (0:19:18.14)
▶ Mimi Pearlbaton : Aye-aye! Hey, Bro. (0:19:20.57)
▶ Mimi Pearlbaton : Beat him now, and you'll look awesome! (0:19:22.79)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : Yeah, I got this! (0:19:25.13)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : Bring it on, Archbishop! (0:19:27.74)
▶ Petelgeuse Romanee-Conti : What... (0:19:29.52)
▶ Petelgeuse Romanee-Conti : Just what... What are you?! (0:19:31.04)
▶ Petelgeuse Romanee-Conti : That cannot be. (0:19:35.98)
▶ Petelgeuse Romanee-Conti : None of this is in the Gospel,
in the guide to my destiny! (0:19:37.72)
▶ Petelgeuse Romanee-Conti : What... Just what are you? (0:19:42.81)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : You've asked that four times. (0:19:46.58)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : If we're talking nightmares,
I've had far more than you. (0:19:49.29)
▶ Petelgeuse Romanee-Conti : Then... Then, then... You truly are Pride's... (0:19:51.68)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : My name is Natsuki Subaru, (0:19:55.94)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : the silver-haired, half-elf Emilia's knight. (0:19:58.57)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : I don't know anything about this "Pride"
stuff, but that's the only title I want. (0:20:03.69)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : I don't need any others. (0:20:08.42)
▶ Petelgeuse Romanee-Conti : This place is... (0:20:15.28)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : It's a place where my time once ended. (0:20:17.46)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : And it will be where your time ends, too. (0:20:21.26)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : That's what this place is. (0:20:27.98)
▶ Petelgeuse Romanee-Conti : If your goal was to lead me out here, (0:20:30.06)
▶ Petelgeuse Romanee-Conti : what have you prepared for me? (0:20:33.89)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : What else? Your natural enemy. (0:20:36.26)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : One you and I have in common... (0:20:38.95)
▶ Julius Euclius : "Natural enemy"? (0:20:44.35)
▶ Julius Euclius : Now, that's a fine thing to call me. (0:20:45.53)
▶ Julius Euclius : I am Julius Euclius, of the
Lugunica Imperial Knights. (0:20:54.43)
▶ Julius Euclius : I am the Kingdom's sword that will slay you. (0:20:59.16)
▶ Petelgeuse Romanee-Conti : A spirit arts user, are you? (0:21:02.37)
▶ Petelgeuse Romanee-Conti : How truly... How truly... (0:21:05.28)
▶ Petelgeuse Romanee-Conti : Is this also part of your plot? (0:21:08.60)
▶ Petelgeuse Romanee-Conti : I have never known such humiliation! (0:21:11.07)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : Really? Well, make the most of it. (0:21:14.66)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : That's your bill for all you've done. (0:21:17.83)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : Let's do it, Julius. (0:21:22.36)
▶ Julius Euclius : Are you sure? (0:21:24.22)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : I won't back down, I won't bend, I can't lose. (0:21:26.75)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : I don't want to lose anyone else. (0:21:29.55)
▶ Julius Euclius : I am the man who brutally beat you. (0:21:32.21)
▶ Julius Euclius : I still believe my behavior was
backed by meaning and reason, (0:21:35.74)
▶ Julius Euclius : but that is no more than self-justification, (0:21:40.41)
▶ Julius Euclius : which has nothing to do with you. (0:21:43.11)
▶ Julius Euclius : Can you trust me? (0:21:46.99)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : I hate you. (0:21:51.49)
▶ Julius Euclius : Yes, I know. (0:21:54.70)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : Having someone break your arms
and legs like that is traumatic. (0:21:57.12)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : Don't you know the meaning of restraint? (0:22:00.38)
▶ Julius Euclius : Just so you know, I did hold back quite a bit. (0:22:03.35)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : Seriously? That was you holding back? (0:22:07.05)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : You really are the biggest jerk. (0:22:10.45)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : I really hate you, greatest knight. (0:22:14.02)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : So... (0:22:19.21)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : I will trust you. (0:22:21.27)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : My shame attests to my knowledge
that you are an incredible knight. (0:22:24.05)
▶ Julius Euclius : Then, with all my soul... (0:22:29.04)
▶ Julius Euclius : I shall live up to that! (0:22:33.17)
▶ Petelgeuse Romanee-Conti : Is this farce over yet? (0:22:35.89)
▶ Petelgeuse Romanee-Conti : What do you expect adding a single
spirit arts user to your ranks will do? (0:22:39.01)
▶ Petelgeuse Romanee-Conti : I will defeat you all, tear apart
those who remain, (0:22:43.57)
▶ Petelgeuse Romanee-Conti : resume the Ordeal, and that is all. (0:22:46.92)
▶ Petelgeuse Romanee-Conti : My diligence knows neither slothful
resignation nor demise! (0:22:49.34)
▶ Petelgeuse Romanee-Conti : Sloth! Sloth! Sloth! (0:22:56.00)
▶ Petelgeuse Romanee-Conti : Sloth! (0:22:58.49)
▶ Julius Euclius : Al Clarista! (0:23:01.18)
▶ Petelgeuse Romanee-Conti : You... You should not be able to see it. (0:23:12.83)
▶ Petelgeuse Romanee-Conti : It should be invisible to you. (0:23:16.01)
▶ Petelgeuse Romanee-Conti : My Unseen Hand can't be seen, can't be seen... (0:23:17.76)
▶ Petelgeuse Romanee-Conti : You can't see it! (0:23:20.83)
▶ Petelgeuse Romanee-Conti : And by two... Two people other than me! (0:23:22.16)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : I'm the only one who can see it, Betelgeuse. (0:23:24.97)
▶ Petelgeuse Romanee-Conti : Huh? (0:23:27.66)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : Julius can only see what I'm seeing. (0:23:29.30)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : It also feels much creepier than I expected. (0:23:33.25)
▶ Julius Euclius : I can use Nect to consciously
share your senses, (0:23:36.16)
▶ Julius Euclius : as well as to maintain them for a while. (0:23:39.35)
▶ Julius Euclius : When you first proposed this,
I questioned your sanity. (0:23:42.43)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : It worked, didn't it? (0:23:47.46)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : A man's all about guts. (0:23:49.64)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : You've gotta be open to anything. (0:23:51.10)
▶ Petelgeuse Romanee-Conti : Curse you, curse you... (0:23:54.71)
▶ Petelgeuse Romanee-Conti : Curse you! Curse you! Curse you! Curse you! (0:23:56.63)
▶ Petelgeuse Romanee-Conti : Curse you! (0:23:59.57)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : Sharing a collective body with
you is pretty disgusting. (0:24:04.26)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : Let's get this over with. (0:24:07.71)
▶ Julius Euclius : Yes, let's. (0:24:09.66)
▶ Julius Euclius : Using your eyes, I shall slay him... (0:24:16.65)
▶ Julius Euclius : My friend, Natsuki Subaru! (0:24:23.04)▶ Wilhelm van Astrea : I have a slight concern. (0:00:07.17)
▶ Wilhelm van Astrea : I would like to take a small number
from our forces to eliminate it. (0:00:10.56)
▶ Emilia : You won't have any need of me? (0:00:16.42)
▶ Wilhelm van Astrea : Emilia-sama, head to safety in the carriage. (0:00:20.83)
▶ Wilhelm van Astrea : Do not release the children's hands. (0:00:24.62)
▶ Wilhelm van Astrea : You truly are master and servant. (0:00:30.81)
▶ Wilhelm van Astrea : Your eyes look just like his. (0:00:33.59)
▶ Emilia : Wilhelm-san, I— (0:00:42.91)
▶ Petelgeuse Romanee-Conti : This cannot be... (0:01:13.40)
▶ Petelgeuse Romanee-Conti : You cannot use such means, such tricks, (0:01:15.97)
▶ Petelgeuse Romanee-Conti : to make light of me and of my devotion! (0:01:18.75)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : This is some crappy game where,
once as you're caught, it's over. (0:01:32.14)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : We must be crazy to entrust our lives to it, (0:01:35.44)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : you and me both! (0:01:38.64)
▶ Julius Euclius : My body is slowly getting used to this. (0:01:40.18)
▶ Julius Euclius : Shall we speed up? (0:01:42.43)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : Yeah! Don't worry, I'll keep up! (0:01:43.68)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : Wow. (0:01:52.79)
▶ Petelgeuse Romanee-Conti : Impossible. (0:01:54.62)
▶ Petelgeuse Romanee-Conti : Impossible, impossible, impossible, impossible. (0:01:55.66)
▶ Petelgeuse Romanee-Conti : Impossible! (0:01:58.32)
▶ Petelgeuse Romanee-Conti : Why? How can it be? (0:02:01.13)
▶ Petelgeuse Romanee-Conti : I thought I was loved! I am loved! (0:02:03.50)
▶ Petelgeuse Romanee-Conti : By the witch, the witch, the witch, the witch. (0:02:07.25)
▶ Petelgeuse Romanee-Conti : The witch! (0:02:09.98)

▶ Petelgeuse Romanee-Conti : What is this? (0:02:52.25)
▶ Julius Euclius : You lost because you belittled
him as powerless. (0:02:59.50)
▶ Julius Euclius : My blade, of all six elements together,
will slice your very soul apart. (0:03:03.78)

▶ Subaru Natsuki : I was prepared to keep
trying until you left me, (0:04:26.67)

How cowardly can you be? (0:04:31.17)
▶ Julius Euclius : This time, I will end you. (0:04:35.49)

▶ Otto Suwen : There are enough magic stones to
easily blow away a small village. (0:05:56.11)
▶ Felix Argyle : Ketty's carriage is taking Emilia-sama
and the children to the capital. (0:06:04.83)
▶ EXTRA : Emilia-sama... (0:06:17.36)
▶ EXTRA : It's time. (0:06:19.57)
▶ EXTRA : What's wrong? (0:06:21.97)
▶ EXTRA : Are you okay? (0:06:23.36)
▶ Emilia : I'm sorry. It's nothing. (0:06:25.09)
▶ Emilia : Come on, let's hurry! (0:06:27.49)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : Damn it! (0:06:35.59)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : My poor man's tendency to use
anything at hand backfired! (0:06:36.62)
▶ Julius Euclius : We have verified that no spell
was used to set a trap, (0:06:39.99)
▶ Julius Euclius : but if something were physically
rigged in the carriage... (0:06:42.71)
▶ Felix Argyle : Felis, could a ground dragon catch up to them? (0:06:47.31)
▶ Felix Argyle : Once they leave the Mathers domain
and get on the Lifaus Highway, (0:06:51.01)
▶ Felix Argyle : it'll be hard to catch them. (0:06:54.29)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : That still wasn't enough? (0:06:56.85)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : Even after all that, I still can't... (0:06:58.74)
▶ Otto Suwen : May I say something? (0:07:01.73)
▶ Otto Suwen : Right now, I'm actually
in a desperate position. (0:07:04.72)
▶ Otto Suwen : If you would accept a trade, (0:07:08.10)
▶ Otto Suwen : I promise to catch up to
the carriage that lef— (0:07:10.56)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : If there's anything I can do, I'll do it! (0:07:12.64)
▶ Otto Suwen : I like a man who can decide
quickly, Natsuki-san! (0:07:16.07)
▶ Julius Euclius : I'll send Ia with you. (0:07:21.46)
▶ Julius Euclius : I wish I could accompany you myself, but... (0:07:23.91)
▶ Felix Argyle : You can't, Julius. (0:07:27.60)
▶ Felix Argyle : With all those injuries, how could
you help them? (0:07:29.01)
▶ Felix Argyle : And your mana's nyot restored yet, either. (0:07:31.66)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : You just get some rest. (0:07:33.97)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : Once this is over, we'll celebrate! (0:07:36.09)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : I'll make sure to invite you, so don't die. (0:07:38.18)
▶ Felix Argyle : Don't you die, either! (0:07:41.28)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : Good luck. (0:07:43.68)
▶ Otto Suwen : Rather than take this road, (0:07:47.11)
▶ Otto Suwen : it's faster to go through
the glade to the left. (0:07:49.27)
▶ Otto Suwen : It's the shortest way! (0:07:52.24)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : Man, your "soul of language"
divine protection is amazing. (0:07:56.32)
▶ Otto Suwen : I had a hard time learning to control it. (0:07:59.01)
▶ Otto Suwen : Since I can hear all creatures' voices,
from ground dragons to insects. (0:08:02.31)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : But if we choose our path
based on what they say, (0:08:06.75)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : this shortcut will work, and catching up
to Emilia and the kids will be easy! (0:08:09.67)
▶ Otto Suwen : What are you talking about? (0:08:13.38)
▶ Otto Suwen : It won't be easy at all! (0:08:15.09)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : We're gonna die! (0:08:22.24)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : At this rate, we're seriously gonna die. (0:08:24.59)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : What next?! (0:08:26.35)
▶ Otto Suwen : What is this? I feel a wind hitting me. (0:08:27.25)
▶ Otto Suwen : Honestly, even I had no idea
I was capable of this— (0:08:30.09)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : What is it? What's wrong? (0:08:34.80)
▶ Otto Suwen : The trees are so loud. (0:08:36.94)
▶ Otto Suwen : The birds and bugs began to make
a lot of noise, and then just vanished. (0:08:39.64)
▶ Otto Suwen : Something... Something is coming! (0:08:43.82)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : Faster, Otto! Don't get
caught, no matter what! (0:08:55.08)
▶ Otto Suwen : Natsuki-san? (0:08:58.25)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : Just how persistent are you, damn it?! (0:09:02.71)
▶ Petelgeuse Romanee-Conti : My body! (0:09:07.99)
▶ Petelgeuse Romanee-Conti : My flesh body! (0:09:10.21)
▶ Emilia : It's okay. Hang on tight. (0:09:20.20)
▶ Emilia : There's nothing to fear. (0:09:22.64)
▶ Puck : That old man just ran into
someone behind us. (0:09:27.44)
▶ Puck : They're fighting. (0:09:31.04)
▶ Emilia : Do you know how many? (0:09:32.63)
▶ Puck : A lot. (0:09:34.23)
▶ Puck : But the old man's power is no joke. (0:09:35.92)
▶ Puck : Seems you and I won't be needed this time. (0:09:39.62)
▶ Puck : Taking physical form without
reason drains mana, (0:09:42.50)
▶ Puck : and I wouldn't want these
kids ending up their toys. (0:09:44.91)
▶ Emilia : If we could hide everyone's
fear behind your cuteness, (0:09:47.46)
▶ Emilia : I think that could work, though. (0:09:50.59)
▶ Puck : You say some scary things, my daughter. (0:09:52.62)
▶ Emilia : Don't worry. (0:09:57.39)
▶ Emilia : Whatever happens, I'll protect you. (0:09:58.57)
▶ EXTRA : W-We're fine! (0:10:01.92)
▶ EXTRA : You don't have to worry about us! (0:10:03.33)
▶ EXTRA : W-We made a promise, so this is nothing! (0:10:07.00)
▶ Emilia : A promise? (0:10:09.87)
▶ EXTRA : That we wouldn't let you go! (0:10:11.22)
▶ EXTRA : Because if we aren't with you,
you'll do something crazy! (0:10:13.58)
▶ EXTRA : And he'll worry if someone doesn't watch you! (0:10:16.31)
▶ Emilia : Worry about me? Who told you this? (0:10:20.35)
▶ EXTRA : Don't! We can't tell— (0:10:23.66)
▶ EXTRA : Subaru! (0:10:24.80)
▶ EXTRA : Subaru said it. (0:10:25.83)
▶ EXTRA : He said you get lonely easily,
so he was worried! (0:10:27.37)
▶ EXTRA : Subaru said... (0:10:30.13)
▶ EXTRA : Wait, we weren't supposed to tell her. (0:10:31.65)
▶ EXTRA : Oh, boy... (0:10:34.60)
▶ Otto Suwen : Natsuki-san, is something
coming up behind us? (0:10:40.86)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : Just some big, black animal. (0:10:43.76)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : It has a wild voice and a scary face,
so you're better off not looking. (0:10:47.42)
▶ Otto Suwen : Those things make me all the more curious! (0:10:50.84)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : Forget it! Just drive! (0:10:53.60)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : If it bites me, it'll munch on you next! (0:10:55.20)
▶ Otto Suwen : Yikes! (0:10:57.87)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : How many times do I have
to play the last level? (0:11:00.57)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : What about you is slothful now,
you uselessly hard worker? (0:11:03.23)
▶ Petelgeuse Romanee-Conti : Witch! Satella! Give me... (0:11:06.69)
▶ Petelgeuse Romanee-Conti : Love! Love! (0:11:09.95)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : She doesn't love you or me... (0:11:10.46)
▶ Petelgeuse Romanee-Conti : Love! Love! Love! Love! Love! (0:11:11.05)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : In what kind of rom-com does someone
try to squash their love's heart? (0:11:13.18)
▶ Petelgeuse Romanee-Conti : Satella! Satella! Satella! (0:11:15.25)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : I am your opponent. (0:11:19.25)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : I won't let you past me. (0:11:21.30)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : And I absolutely won't let you
get to the kid in front of me! (0:11:23.26)
▶ Otto Suwen : Natsuki-san, you care about me that much? (0:11:27.37)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : Will you be quiet? (0:11:30.03)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : I'm trying to make myself look good. (0:11:31.48)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : Take this! (0:11:39.89)
▶ Otto Suwen : Natsuki-san, we're leaving the forest! (0:11:41.19)
▶ Petelgeuse Romanee-Conti : Love... (0:11:49.11)
▶ Petelgeuse Romanee-Conti : Love... Love me. (0:11:49.97)
▶ Petelgeuse Romanee-Conti : Love alone is everything! (0:11:51.50)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : I can't take you with me to where Emilia is! (0:11:54.98)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : I'm gonna need your strength, (0:12:06.03)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : Julius Euclius! (0:12:08.24)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : Rental Goa! (0:12:11.64)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : Damn, that hurts... (0:12:22.41)
▶ Petelgeuse Romanee-Conti : Give it to me. (0:12:25.32)
▶ Petelgeuse Romanee-Conti : Hand it over. (0:12:27.02)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : I told you... (0:12:28.38)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : If you try to enter my body,
you're just gonna get hurt! (0:12:29.79)
▶ Petelgeuse Romanee-Conti : The witch... Satella... Satella! (0:12:34.65)
▶ Petelgeuse Romanee-Conti : I haven't forgotten a single moment
of the things you did for me! (0:12:38.10)
▶ Petelgeuse Romanee-Conti : Even if you've forgotten, I'll... I'll... (0:12:43.50)
▶ Petelgeuse Romanee-Conti : With all of my diligence, (0:12:47.37)
▶ Petelgeuse Romanee-Conti : I'll part with my slothful self,
to repay your love... (0:12:49.89)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : If you had stayed a monster... (0:12:51.58)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : You might have beaten me! (0:12:54.62)
▶ Petelgeuse Romanee-Conti : Satella... (0:13:00.83)
▶ Petelgeuse Romanee-Conti : I... will not... I won't... let it end. (0:13:14.01)
▶ Petelgeuse Romanee-Conti : This hasn't ended... (0:13:17.76)
▶ Petelgeuse Romanee-Conti : It hasn't. (0:13:21.17)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : No, it's over. (0:13:23.06)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : As of now, you (0:13:25.21)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : are finished! (0:13:27.64)
▶ Petelgeuse Romanee-Conti : Natsuki Subaru! (0:13:41.03)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : This time, stay asleep forever, Betelgeuse. (0:13:52.93)
▶ Otto Suwen : Natsuki-san, look! (0:13:57.45)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : Wilhelm-san! (0:14:06.03)
▶ Wilhelm van Astrea : Subaru-dono! (0:14:07.79)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : Where's Emilia? (0:14:09.39)
▶ Wilhelm van Astrea : Just ahead. (0:14:15.76)
▶ Wilhelm van Astrea : Go straight, toward the great tree. (0:14:16.79)
▶ Wilhelm van Astrea : This is the perfect chance to repay my debt. (0:14:21.76)
▶ Wilhelm van Astrea : Who can stand in the way of a man
on his way to see a woman? (0:14:24.65)
▶ Otto Suwen : Natsuki-san, I see it! (0:14:35.24)
▶ Otto Suwen : That's the carriage with the refugees! (0:14:36.94)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : Back then, I promised. (0:14:48.50)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : No matter what it takes... (0:14:56.05)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : I'm going to save you. (0:15:00.26)
▶ Puck : Are you thinking about Subaru? (0:15:07.19)
▶ Emilia : Yeah. (0:15:10.21)
▶ Emilia : But I still can't believe it. (0:15:11.48)
▶ Puck : If Subaru's really leading the army, (0:15:14.51)
▶ Puck : lots of things would make sense. (0:15:17.30)
▶ Ram : Like why Ram didn't argue, (0:15:19.27)
▶ Ram : and why the villagers agreed to evacuate. (0:15:21.39)
▶ Emilia : But why? (0:15:25.06)
▶ Emilia : After all the pain and suffering
he went through... (0:15:27.40)
▶ Emilia : After I made him look so sad... (0:15:31.12)
▶ Emilia : Why would he... (0:15:34.75)
▶ Puck : Lia, something is coming up behind us. (0:15:38.48)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : Found them! (0:16:14.46)
▶ Puck : I thought this reunion was sudden.
So that's why you're here. (0:16:17.66)
▶ Emilia : Wait! Why? (0:16:24.23)
▶ Emilia : Why? (0:16:32.88)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : I love you, Emilia. (0:16:36.72)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : Damn it! (0:17:00.19)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : Get there in time! (0:17:01.41)
▶ Emilia : Thank you, Subaru. (0:17:17.88)
▶ Emilia : For saving me. (0:17:19.78)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : Where am I? (0:17:45.78)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : I can't see a thing. (0:17:48.29)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : I can't hear a thing. (0:17:50.30)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : Is that witch lady coming
to grab my heart again? (0:17:52.70)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : I don't feel too bad, though. (0:17:56.82)
▶ Emilia : Subaru! (0:17:58.45)
▶ Emilia : Subaru! (0:17:59.92)
▶ Emilia : Subaru! (0:18:01.54)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : Oh, hey. I can hear, after all. (0:18:03.15)
▶ Emilia : Subaru! (0:18:39.12)
▶ Emilia : Subaru, you're awake? (0:19:02.11)
▶ Emilia : Thank goodness... I'm so glad. (0:19:04.58)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : I'm lying down, and Emilia is kneeling. (0:19:07.82)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : And considering our distance and the
heavenly sensation under my head... (0:19:13.15)
▶ Emilia : You don't have to go through all that. (0:19:19.02)
▶ Emilia : Your head is on my lap. It isn't
uncomfortable, is it? (0:19:21.17)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : I know of no finer, more divine pillow. (0:19:24.39)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : Um... (0:19:30.08)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : Can I ask how things turned out? (0:19:31.66)
▶ Emilia : Honestly... (0:19:35.36)
▶ Emilia : I'm the one who wants to ask what's going on. (0:19:36.73)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : Is Patrasche okay? (0:19:40.70)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : I wanna become the wind
with that little guy again. (0:19:42.69)
▶ Emilia : He was pretty burned, (0:19:46.00)
▶ Emilia : but he'll be fine. (0:19:47.85)
▶ Emilia : Felis is looking at him. (0:19:50.21)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : Oh, Felis joined us, too? (0:19:52.13)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : Have I been out for a pretty long time? (0:19:54.46)
▶ Emilia : About an hour or two. (0:19:59.21)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : Then, everyone's together now? (0:20:01.33)
▶ Emilia : Julius, as well. (0:20:04.61)
▶ Emilia : I was really surprised. (0:20:07.01)
▶ Emilia : I never expected to see you two together. (0:20:09.75)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : It was for reasons bluer than the mountains, (0:20:14.00)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : and taller than the seas, Emilia-tan. (0:20:16.38)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : I finally made it back. (0:20:29.91)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : I feel like I was having a really long dream. (0:20:34.48)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : A terrible dream... (0:20:38.16)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : No, it wasn't. (0:20:40.19)
▶ Emilia : A good dream, then? (0:20:42.50)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : A good reality. (0:20:45.90)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : Back then, you asked me why... (0:20:49.76)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : Why I saved you, (0:20:53.98)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : why I try so hard at everything. (0:20:56.26)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : You asked me why. (0:20:59.26)
▶ Emilia : Yeah. (0:21:01.61)
▶ Emilia : And you said it was because I saved you... (0:21:03.09)
▶ Emilia : But I haven't done anything like that. (0:21:08.43)
▶ Emilia : I've never been able to. (0:21:12.24)
▶ Emilia : You're the one who's always saving me. (0:21:14.59)
▶ Emilia : I never could do anything for you. (0:21:17.79)
▶ Emilia : And yet, you got yourself hurt,
and said it was for my sake... (0:21:20.29)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : No, I was messed up back then. (0:21:24.23)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : I was thinking only of myself. (0:21:29.90)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : I said it was all for you, (0:21:32.51)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : when I was really just drunk on
the idea of doing it for you. (0:21:34.48)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : I had it in my head that if I
said that, you'd accept it. (0:21:38.08)
▶ Emilia : Subaru... (0:21:42.80)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : I'm sorry. (0:21:44.68)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : I used you for my own self-satisfaction. (0:21:46.34)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : Everything you said back then was true. (0:21:50.40)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : I was wrong. (0:21:53.70)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : But... (0:21:55.93)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : There's one thing I wasn't wrong about. (0:21:57.92)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : I want to save you. (0:22:00.90)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : I want to help you. (0:22:02.65)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : I honestly mean that. It's no lie. (0:22:04.56)
▶ Emilia : Yeah. I know. (0:22:08.85)
▶ Emilia : Why do you always save me? (0:22:13.86)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : Because I love you. (0:22:19.29)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : And I want to be your strength. (0:22:21.98)
▶ Emilia : I'm a half-elf... (0:22:32.81)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : I know that. (0:22:35.38)
▶ Emilia : I'm a silver-haired half-elf, (0:22:36.78)
▶ Emilia : and many people hate me because
I look like the witch. (0:22:40.21)
▶ Emilia : They despise me... (0:22:44.55)
▶ Emilia : They absolutely detest me! (0:22:46.53)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : I saw. I know. (0:22:48.70)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : Those guys are all blind. (0:22:50.22)
▶ Emilia : I don't have much experience with people, (0:22:52.90)
▶ Emilia : so I don't have friends. (0:22:55.23)
▶ Emilia : I'm naïve and not very worldly, so I
say strange things sometimes. (0:22:57.04)
▶ Emilia : And the reason I want to be the kingdom's
ruler is really, really selfish. (0:23:01.39)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : No matter what anyone says about you, (0:23:07.06)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : no matter what you think of yourself, (0:23:09.52)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : I love you. (0:23:11.94)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : I really love you! Like crazy! (0:23:13.82)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : I want to be with you all the time. (0:23:16.64)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : I want to hold your hand all the time. (0:23:18.58)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : If you name ten things
you hate about yourself, (0:23:21.04)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : I'll say two thousand things I love about you. (0:23:24.62)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : That's the kind of (0:23:29.08)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : special treatment I want to give you. (0:23:33.74)
▶ Emilia : That's the first time I've received special
treatment that made me happy... (0:23:39.25)
▶ Emilia : Why two thousand? (0:23:49.39)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : Because a hundredfold isn't enough
to express how I feel about you. (0:23:52.31)
▶ Emilia : I'm happy... (0:23:58.21)
▶ Emilia : I'm so happy. (0:24:00.38)
▶ Emilia : I never even imagined I'd see the day (0:24:03.37)
▶ Emilia : that someone told me they loved me. (0:24:07.05)
▶ Emilia : What should I do? (0:24:10.22)
▶ Emilia : You've told me so many of your feelings, (0:24:13.09)
▶ Emilia : but I don't know what to do... (0:24:18.23)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : You don't have to stress over it. (0:24:22.14)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : I'm not demanding an answer right away. (0:24:24.11)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : As far as I'm concerned, it's written in
stone that you'll give me an answer. (0:24:26.87)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : And it'll be a positive one, at that. (0:24:30.42)
▶ Emilia : Is it really all right? (0:24:32.49)
▶ Emilia : For me... For someone like me to be
given such happiness all the time? (0:24:35.09)
▶ Emilia : To be so overjoyed... (0:24:41.50)
▶ Emilia : I actually feel like it's indulgent. (0:24:44.02)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : Sure, it is. Go on and be indulgent. (0:24:46.09)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : You can never have too much happiness. (0:24:49.10)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : If you have so much that it overflows,
you can always share it. (0:24:52.45)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : You can take your time, Emilia. (0:24:57.69)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : You can take your time and slowly,
steadily fall in love with me. (0:25:01.73)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : I'll do my best, so I can walk by your side.
So you'll fall head over heels for me. (0:25:07.56)
▶ Emilia : Thank you, Subaru... (0:25:23.23)
▶ Emilia : For saving me. (0:25:25.54)
