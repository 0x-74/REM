The question is... (0:03:55.73)

to leave me here alone? (0:05:21.00)

The cute girl who summoned... me... (0:05:23.80)

talkin' about, but I'm busy! (0:05:51.03)
▶ Felt : Sorry! Live strong! (0:05:54.55)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : Wait, what? What?! (0:06:00.00)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : Hey, that didn't make you decide to be less
hostile toward me, by any chance, did it? (0:06:04.59)
▶ Ton : Actually, it rained on our
parade and made things worse. (0:06:08.04)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : Yeah, of course... (0:06:10.17)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : Just calm down, Natsuki Subaru. (0:06:11.74)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : Since ancient times, it's the rule that anyone (0:06:13.78)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : summoned into a parallel world
will display supernatural powers! (0:06:15.76)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : I'll mow these guys down and make
them fuel for my shining future! (0:06:18.35)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : You lumps of EXP! (0:06:23.07)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : That's the first time I ever hit someone! (0:06:31.22)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : I didn't expect it to hurt me that much... (0:06:32.69)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : But this world is set up
so that I'll be strong! (0:06:35.29)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : My adrenaline is surging! I've got this! (0:06:38.68)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : I'm sorry! It was all my fault!
Forgive me! Spare me! (0:06:43.57)
▶ Kan : Play games with us, will you?! Die, scum! (0:06:54.66)
▶ Chin : And don't think it'll be painless! (0:07:02.32)
▶ Emilia : That's enough. (0:07:12.50)
▶ Chin : Who the hell are you?! (0:07:27.14)
▶ Emilia : Stop now, and I'll let this slide. (0:07:29.02)
▶ Emilia : So just graciously return what you stole. (0:07:30.86)
▶ Ton : What we stole? (0:07:39.74)
▶ Emilia : Now, please. It's important to me. (0:07:41.15)
▶ Emilia : I'll give up on the other stuff,
but I can't let you have that. (0:07:43.34)
▶ Emilia : Be good and hand it over, please. (0:07:46.81)
▶ Ton : You didn't come to save this kid? (0:07:49.05)
▶ Emilia : What strange clothes he has... (0:07:52.08)
▶ Emilia : If you asked me whether I had any
connection to him, I'd have to say no. (0:07:53.73)
▶ Ton : Then you've got no business with us! (0:07:57.99)
▶ Ton : If someone stole from you,
it was that brat who just ran by! (0:07:59.98)
▶ Kan : Yeah! That way! She ran that way! (0:08:02.52)
▶ Emilia : Hmm... They don't seem to be lying... (0:08:05.53)
▶ Emilia : I need to go after her! (0:08:08.58)
▶ Emilia : But regardless of that... (0:08:14.23)
▶ Emilia : I can't overlook what's going on here. (0:08:16.81)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : Magic? (0:08:25.21)
▶ Chin : Mess with us, will you?! (0:08:26.37)
▶ Chin : I don't care if you can
use magic! I'll kill you! (0:08:29.14)
▶ Chin : You think you can win when
it's two against one?! Huh?! (0:08:31.73)
▶ Emilia : You're right. Two against one may be unfair. (0:08:34.83)
▶ Puck : Two against two should make it fair, then. (0:08:37.72)
▶ Ton : You're a user of the spiritual arts? (0:08:47.05)
▶ Emilia : Correct. Back off now and
I won't come after you. (0:08:49.22)
▶ Emilia : Decide quick. I'm in a hurry. (0:08:52.34)
▶ Chin : You bitch! Next time I see
you, I won't go easy on you! (0:08:54.26)
▶ Puck : Do anything to her, and I'll
haunt you and your kin forever. (0:08:57.75)
▶ Puck : Not that you'll have any kin if I do that. (0:09:00.63)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : You saved me. Thanks. (0:09:08.56)
▶ Emilia : Don't move. (0:09:10.36)
▶ Emilia : See? You averted your eyes because
you have a guilty conscience! (0:09:16.79)
▶ Emilia : Looks like my judgment was spot-on. (0:09:19.80)
▶ Puck : Are you sure? (0:09:22.04)
▶ Puck : I think it was just an
instinctive male reaction. (0:09:23.60)
▶ Puck : I didn't sense any malice at all. (0:09:26.50)
▶ Emilia : You be quiet, Puck. (0:09:28.62)
▶ Emilia : You know who stole my insignia
from me, don't you? (0:09:30.42)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : Uh, sorry, but I don't
have the slightest idea. (0:09:34.13)
▶ Emilia : Huh? Wait, it can't be! (0:09:42.09)
▶ Emilia : Did I really just come around the long way? (0:09:44.28)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : You should probably hurry after her, miss. (0:09:48.08)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : I could... help... (0:09:51.23)
▶ Puck : Aww, you shouldn't have tried to get up. (0:09:52.94)
▶ Puck : What should we do? (0:09:55.57)
▶ Emilia : It's none of our business. (0:09:56.86)
▶ Emilia : He won't die. We'll just leave him. (0:09:58.12)
▶ Puck : Really? (0:10:00.41)
▶ Emilia : Yes, really. (0:10:01.16)
▶ Puck : You say that, but I bet
you'll still help him. (0:10:02.15)
▶ Emilia : I will not! (0:10:04.38)
▶ Puck : Yeah, right. (0:10:05.43)
▶ Emilia : Absolutely not! I am not going to save him! (0:10:06.71)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : She's even super cute when she's mad. (0:10:10.42)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : That's a parallel world fantasy for you... (0:10:14.17)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : Is my head on someone's lap? (0:10:23.75)
▶ Emilia : You're awake? (0:10:26.68)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : I didn't know cute girls were this hairy... (0:10:27.70)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : Wait, that can't be right! (0:10:30.79)
▶ Puck : It's just a thoughtful arrangement we made (0:10:35.33)
▶ Puck : so you could at least feel
happy until you woke up. (0:10:37.42)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : First of all, don't talk in that high voice! (0:10:40.43)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : No sane guy confuses a cat
for the main heroine! (0:10:42.54)
▶ Puck : Aww, making myself bigger was
worth it to see you so happy. (0:10:45.16)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : I'm not happy! (0:10:49.47)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : I'm sorry about this. (0:10:54.43)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : You stayed with me the whole
time I was unconscious... (0:10:56.17)
▶ Emilia : Don't get the wrong idea. (0:10:59.09)
▶ Emilia : I had to stay because there
are things I want to ask you. (0:11:00.48)
▶ Emilia : Healing your wounds and making Puck
your pillow until you woke up (0:11:03.51)
▶ Emilia : were for my own benefit. (0:11:08.49)
▶ Emilia : So I need you to repay me in kind. (0:11:09.99)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : For such a normal favor, you're making
it sound like I really owe you big. (0:11:11.94)
▶ Emilia : No such thing. (0:11:15.90)
▶ Emilia : You have some idea who
stole my insignia, right? (0:11:17.22)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : Insignia? (0:11:20.59)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : You mean one of those badge things
that shows your affiliation? (0:11:21.78)
▶ Emilia : It has a jewel in the center, (0:11:25.35)
▶ Emilia : and it's about this big. (0:11:28.14)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : Sorry, but no matter how many
times you ask me, I have no idea. (0:11:30.48)
▶ Emilia : I see. No helping that, then. (0:11:34.05)
▶ Emilia : But you've given me the information
that you know nothing, (0:11:36.39)
▶ Emilia : and you gave me my answer,
in return for healing you. (0:11:40.17)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : Huh? (0:11:42.93)
▶ Emilia : Well, I'm in a hurry, so I'm going now. (0:11:43.64)
▶ Emilia : Your wounds should be better now, (0:11:46.04)
▶ Emilia : but next time, don't do dangerous things,
like wandering into deserted alleys alone. (0:11:47.85)
▶ Emilia : I'm not concerned. I'm just warning you. (0:11:51.99)
▶ Emilia : If that happens to you again,
saving you won't be of any benefit to me, (0:11:53.65)
▶ Emilia : so don't expect me to help. (0:11:57.76)
▶ Puck : Sorry about her. She's so insincere. (0:12:01.35)
▶ Puck : Don't think badly of her. (0:12:04.25)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : Insincere? (0:12:10.72)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : I think this goes beyond that. (0:12:12.92)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : She was in such a hurry to find
what was stolen from her, (0:12:14.84)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : yet she stopped to help me. (0:12:17.51)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : And she even came up with that lame excuse
for a favor so I wouldn't feel like I owed her, (0:12:19.34)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : even though I'm a total stranger. (0:12:22.87)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : Anyone who lives like that... (0:12:25.06)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : is gonna end up wasting their whole life! (0:12:30.20)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : Hey! Wait up! (0:12:33.89)
▶ Emilia : What? Just so you know, I can only spend
just a little more time with you. (0:12:37.66)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : I sense you're being a tiny bit lenient... (0:12:42.23)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : Forget that. You lost
something important, right? (0:12:44.01)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : Let me help you. (0:12:46.12)
▶ Emilia : But you said you don't know anything... (0:12:47.80)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : But I remember her face, at least! (0:12:49.69)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : If I see her again, I'll know! (0:12:51.53)
▶ Emilia : You're very strange... (0:12:56.80)
▶ Emilia : Just so you know, I can't
do anything to thank you. (0:12:58.68)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : I don't need you to. (0:13:00.75)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : I want to thank you.
That's why I want to help. (0:13:02.59)
▶ Emilia : I didn't do anything deserving of thanks. (0:13:05.54)
▶ Emilia : I told you, I've already received
compensation for healing your wounds. (0:13:07.68)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : Then... (0:13:11.95)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : I'm going to help you for my own sake, too. (0:13:13.48)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : My objective is... Let's see... (0:13:15.87)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : Yeah! One good deed per day! (0:13:18.56)
▶ Puck : I don't sense any malice. I think
you can just accept his offer. (0:13:24.59)
▶ Puck : The more shields between yourself and
ruffians, the better, after all. (0:13:28.54)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : That's what you want me around for?! (0:13:31.45)
▶ Emilia : I mean it, though.
I can't do anything to thank you. (0:13:34.11)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : No problem. Just leave it to me! (0:13:37.00)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : I talked big, but isn't this town too
huge to find one little thing in? (0:13:56.32)
▶ Emilia : It's the capital of Lugunica. (0:14:01.68)
▶ Emilia : You didn't even know that, um... (0:14:03.76)
▶ Puck : That's right. We haven't
asked your name yet. (0:14:06.64)
▶ Puck : Should we all introduce ourselves? (0:14:09.73)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : Oh, yeah, you're right. (0:14:11.41)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : I'll introduce myself first, then. (0:14:12.93)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : My name is Natsuki Subaru. (0:14:16.38)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : Not only am I clueless,
I'm also broke beyond compare! (0:14:18.45)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : Nice to meet ya! (0:14:21.43)
▶ Puck : When that's all you say,
you really do sound hopeless. (0:14:22.36)
▶ Puck : And I'm Puck! Nice to meet you! (0:14:25.86)
▶ Emilia : It's very unusual to see someone who
can touch a spirit so casually. (0:14:31.33)
▶ Emilia : Where are you from? (0:14:35.22)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : Well, following the usual pattern,
a small island nation to the east. (0:14:36.85)
▶ Emilia : Lugunica is the easternmost
nation on our continental map. (0:14:41.15)
▶ Emilia : There's no nation east of here. (0:14:44.96)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : No way, really?
There's nothing east of here? (0:14:46.90)
▶ Emilia : You have no idea where you
are, you have no money, (0:14:49.39)
▶ Emilia : you can't read, and you have
no one who can help you. (0:14:53.71)
▶ Emilia : You might be in an even more
precarious position than me, um... (0:14:56.47)
▶ Emilia : Subaru... was it? (0:14:59.74)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : Yes, that's my name. (0:15:03.86)
▶ Puck : But when I look at you this way,
you look pretty well-built. (0:15:06.05)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : I do work out every day. (0:15:09.49)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : For a shut-in who's gotta guard
his house, that much is a given. (0:15:11.53)
▶ Emilia : I'm not sure I understand
what a "shut-in" is, (0:15:16.02)
▶ Emilia : but that means you're from a
respectable family, right? (0:15:19.03)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : H-Hey— (0:15:22.12)
▶ Emilia : Your fingers, too. They're very pretty. (0:15:23.27)
▶ Emilia : They're evidence that you don't
live like a peasant at all. (0:15:25.94)
▶ Emilia : And your muscles don't look like
the kind you gain by working. (0:15:28.74)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : Uh, anyway, I know your cat's name now, (0:15:33.07)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : but I haven't heard yours yet. (0:15:36.16)
▶ Emilia : My name? (0:15:37.96)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : Yeah. (0:15:39.07)
▶ Emilia : I'm... (0:15:40.61)
▶ Emilia : Satella. (0:15:44.09)
▶ Emilia : I have no family name.
You can just call me Satella. (0:15:46.16)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : I see... Satella... (0:15:50.17)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : That's a nice name. (0:15:54.07)
▶ Puck : You have terrible taste. (0:15:59.89)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : Okay, time to get back to asking around! (0:16:03.14)
▶ Emilia : Hey, Subaru... (0:16:08.14)
▶ Emilia : Do you get the feeling that child is lost? (0:16:10.08)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : Uh, but what about our questioning? (0:16:17.01)
▶ Emilia : That's important too, but if she's
lost, we have to do something. (0:16:19.24)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : I'm in no place to talk after you saved me, (0:16:25.53)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : but do you understand the position we're in? (0:16:28.03)
▶ Emilia : But... (0:16:30.87)
▶ Emilia : She's crying! Is she not, Subaru? (0:16:32.79)
▶ Emilia : If you can't do this with me, that's fine. (0:16:37.45)
▶ Emilia : Thanks for all your help, Subaru. (0:16:39.87)
▶ Emilia : I'll handle it on my own from here, (0:16:42.20)
▶ Emilia : after I help that little girl. (0:16:44.30)
▶ Emilia : I'm sorry I'm not who you were looking for. (0:16:51.97)
▶ Emilia : So, what's the matter? (0:16:54.63)
▶ Emilia : Aren't your mom and dad with you? (0:16:56.20)
▶ Emilia : Um, uh... Don't cry... (0:17:03.36)
▶ Emilia : I won't do anything to you, okay? (0:17:06.10)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : What I have here is one
grooved-edge ten-yen coin. (0:17:08.76)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : I will now clutch it tightly in my hand. (0:17:13.59)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : Tight, tight, tight... like that! (0:17:17.04)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : And now... Imagine that! (0:17:19.47)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : And this... is where the coin was hiding. (0:17:25.98)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : You can have this. (0:17:32.52)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : It's rare, so take good care of it. (0:17:33.99)
▶ EXTRA : Thank you! (0:17:38.85)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : I see. You got separated from your mom, huh? (0:17:40.96)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : Hey, it'll be fine. (0:17:43.87)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : Just leave it to me and
this young lady here. (0:17:46.28)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : We'll find them for you in no time. (0:17:48.84)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : When we do this, (0:17:52.44)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : people who don't know us probably think
we're a married couple and child, huh? (0:17:53.88)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : How embarrassing. (0:17:58.73)
▶ Emilia : At best, I can't see you as anything
more than her older brother. (0:17:59.62)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : What makes you think I'm that
much younger than you?! (0:18:03.43)
▶ EXTRA : Oh! Mommy! (0:18:05.82)
▶ EXTRA : Mommy! (0:18:10.20)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : Looks like she found her. (0:18:12.16)
▶ Emilia : Yeah. I'm glad. (0:18:13.84)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : So... (0:18:16.78)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : I think we took a pretty long way around, (0:18:18.07)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : but what benefit will you insist
that you got out of this? (0:18:20.78)
▶ Emilia : That's easy. Now we can continue our
search with our minds at ease, right? (0:18:25.20)
▶ Emilia : Anyway, why did you help me? (0:18:30.49)
▶ Emilia : You were against the idea. (0:18:33.05)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : I could say I just wanted
to show off my magic trick, (0:18:34.74)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : but that would be a lie. (0:18:36.80)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : I told you, finding your insignia will
be my one good deed for the day! (0:18:38.30)
▶ Emilia : Then, since you helped the little girl,
isn't your one good deed over? (0:18:42.70)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : That comeback was way too logical! (0:18:46.72)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : Come on, it doesn't hurt to do more
than one nice thing in a day, right? (0:18:48.86)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : I just got tomorrow's out of the way. (0:18:51.85)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : My plan is to get a week's worth
of good deeds taken care of early! (0:18:53.56)
▶ Emilia : Subaru, you're the type that basically
wastes your whole life, aren't you? (0:18:57.32)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : You're the last one I
want saying that to me. (0:19:00.69)
▶ Emilia : You're not a bad boy, though. (0:19:04.17)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : Why are you treating me like
I'm younger than you again? (0:19:05.85)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : I doubt there's that much
difference between us. (0:19:08.36)
▶ Emilia : I don't think making guesses
on that will help you. (0:19:11.13)
▶ Emilia : I'm a half-elf. (0:19:14.42)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : Now I get it. (0:19:21.66)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : No wonder I thought you were so cute! (0:19:24.23)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : Elves are always beautiful, right? (0:19:27.13)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : What? (0:19:32.18)
▶ Emilia : "What"? Well, I mean... I'm a half-elf... (0:19:33.14)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : Yeah, I heard you. (0:19:37.16)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : What'd you do that for? (0:19:48.26)
▶ Puck : I just had to do something about
this unbearable tingle I feel! (0:19:50.01)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : I can't accept being hit
for a reason like that. (0:19:53.30)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : Though I'll forgive you
because it was squishy. (0:19:56.49)
▶ Puck : I didn't hit you out of anger or anything. (0:19:58.03)
▶ Puck : The opposite, in fact. (0:20:00.46)
▶ Emilia : Subaru, you're such a dunderhead! (0:20:02.71)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : Dunderhead? Who says that
in this day and age? (0:20:05.03)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : And why are you insulting me? (0:20:07.54)
▶ Emilia : Hmph! Whatever! (0:20:09.77)
▶ Emilia : More importantly, we have
to get back to the search. (0:20:11.37)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : Hey, hang on! (0:20:15.76)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : Running around without
a plan never ends well. (0:20:17.29)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : There's a basic rule of searches. (0:20:20.16)
▶ Emilia : A basic rule of searches? (0:20:21.78)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : Yep. You revisit the crime
scene a hundred times. (0:20:22.99)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : Where was your insignia stolen? (0:20:25.29)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : So you see, it seems the crime
happened right around here, (0:20:27.59)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : so I came back to this fruit stand after
valiantly telling her to leave it all to me. (0:20:30.89)
▶ Kadomon Risch : What? I thought I had a customer,
but it's just the broke kid? (0:20:34.56)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : Do you really want to take that attitude? (0:20:38.28)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : Haven't you noticed I'm
not who I was before? (0:20:40.32)
▶ Kadomon Risch : What? (0:20:42.99)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : Just look who I brought with me! (0:20:44.22)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : I brought someone who just
might become a regular! (0:20:46.19)
▶ Emilia : Um, Subaru... (0:20:49.40)
▶ Emilia : You seem to have some
weird expectations of me, (0:20:51.17)
▶ Emilia : but I don't have any money, either. (0:20:53.58)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : Huh?! Seriously? (0:20:55.90)
▶ Kadomon Risch : So what did you want to say to me now
that I've got two broke customers, boy? (0:20:57.85)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : We're actually looking for someone, (0:21:03.51)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : and we hoped we could ask
you some questions... (0:21:05.99)
▶ Kadomon Risch : That was a sarcastic way of telling you I
don't have time for losers with no money! (0:21:08.62)
▶ Kadomon Risch : Get outta here! (0:21:11.90)
▶ EXTRA : Mister! (0:21:13.25)
▶ EXTRA : Thanks for your help earlier. (0:21:15.55)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : What brings you back here? (0:21:17.25)
▶ EXTRA : It's my husband's shop,
so we were just stopping by. (0:21:19.22)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : Husband? (0:21:23.31)
▶ Kadomon Risch : Hey, there's my girl. (0:21:29.19)
▶ Kadomon Risch : Wait, you know these broke losers? (0:21:31.59)
▶ EXTRA : She got lost, and they found her. (0:21:35.42)
▶ EXTRA : Here, lady. (0:21:41.07)
▶ EXTRA : Please accept it. (0:21:45.64)
▶ EXTRA : She wants to thank you in her own way. (0:21:47.37)
▶ Emilia : Thank you. (0:21:53.27)
▶ Kadomon Risch : Sorry about that. (0:22:02.80)
▶ Kadomon Risch : You helped my daughter,
and I want to thank you. (0:22:04.62)
▶ Kadomon Risch : You can ask for anything. (0:22:07.33)
▶ Emilia : There, you see? (0:22:11.83)
▶ Emilia : That came back around
and worked in our favor! (0:22:13.03)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : The air, the atmosphere, and most likely, (0:22:34.02)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : the attitudes of the people
living here are awful. (0:22:36.44)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : Are you sure she's here? (0:22:38.85)
▶ Kadomon Risch : It might be that Felt girl. (0:22:41.55)
▶ Kadomon Risch : You said a nimble little blond girl, right? (0:22:44.28)
▶ Kadomon Risch : She's well-known in the slums.
Dunno where she lives, though. (0:22:46.81)
▶ Emilia : Maybe someone will tell us if we ask. (0:22:51.75)
▶ Puck : No one would sell out one of their own,
so I don't think that would work. (0:22:54.02)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : Maybe we should come back later. (0:22:58.80)
▶ Puck : Whether you stay or leave,
you should decide quickly. (0:23:01.42)
▶ Puck : I'm almost out of time. (0:23:04.89)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : You're what? Out of time? (0:23:06.74)
▶ Puck : I have a cute appearance, but I am a spirit. (0:23:08.74)
▶ Puck : It take a lot of mana just
to appear in physical form. (0:23:12.33)
▶ Puck : So at night, I return to
the crystal I was summoned from (0:23:15.97)
▶ Puck : and prepare for the
emergence of the sun. (0:23:18.71)
▶ Puck : On average, my ideal staying time
is from about nine to five. (0:23:22.14)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : Nine to five? You sound
like a civil servant. (0:23:25.71)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : Employment terms for spirits are
more severe than I thought... (0:23:28.41)
▶ Emilia : We'll be fine without Puck.
We have to move forward. (0:23:31.56)
▶ Puck : Yeah. But, sorry... I'm at my limit... (0:23:34.68)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : It's almost like he's dying
when he disappears... (0:23:39.35)
▶ Emilia : Sorry to work you so hard, Puck. (0:23:41.56)
▶ Emilia : We'll handle things from
here, so get some rest. (0:23:43.89)
▶ Puck : Don't do anything reckless. (0:23:49.82)
▶ Puck : If it comes down to it,
use the odo to summon me again. (0:23:52.12)
▶ Puck : Okay, take care of the rest, Subaru. (0:23:56.25)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : Hey, I haven't been alone with a
girl since I was in grade school! (0:24:09.01)
▶ Emilia : Don't get any weird ideas. (0:24:13.95)
▶ Emilia : I can use magic. (0:24:16.06)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : I won't! (0:24:17.67)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : The bigger issue is how
we should find Felt now. (0:24:19.35)
▶ Emilia : I'll ask the lesser spirits. (0:24:22.92)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : Lesser spirits? (0:24:25.21)
▶ Emilia : Lesser spirits are beings that
haven't become spirits yet. (0:24:26.62)
▶ Emilia : They grow over time, and when they
gain strength and self-awareness, (0:24:30.90)
▶ Emilia : they become full spirits, like Puck. (0:24:34.56)▶ Emilia : I'll ask once more. (0:00:20.04)
▶ Emilia : Why did you call me by the
name of the Jealous Witch? (0:00:22.38)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : Because you told me to. (0:00:25.68)
▶ Emilia : I don't know who told you that, (0:00:27.11)
▶ Emilia : but they have terrible taste! (0:00:28.84)
▶ Emilia : The Jealous Witch is the epitome of taboo, (0:00:30.58)
▶ Emilia : and you call me by her name,
which most dare not even say! (0:00:33.04)
▶ EXTRA : That's right! (0:00:36.55)
▶ EXTRA : That's going too far, boy! (0:00:37.56)
▶ Emilia : If you have nothing to say, I'm leaving.
I have things to do. (0:00:40.09)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : Felt! (0:00:48.45)
▶ Emilia : Were you stalling me? (0:01:01.77)
▶ Emilia : Are you working with her?! (0:01:03.26)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : N-No! (0:01:04.85)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : Hey... W-Wait a minute! (0:01:07.50)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : You have it all wrong! I'm... (0:01:09.46)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : Damn it! (0:01:14.69)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : Could someone just treat me a little nicer? (0:02:53.13)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : Why was I even... (0:02:57.72)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : summoned to this world? (0:03:01.75)
▶ Kan : What are you babbling about? (0:03:05.39)
▶ Chin : If you don't wanna get hurt, cough up
whatever you've got! (0:03:07.53)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : Would you stop it already?! (0:03:12.93)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : No one is this damn persistent! (0:03:14.96)
▶ Chin : You think you can mouth off to us? (0:03:17.53)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : You're in my way! I have somewhere I have to go! (0:03:19.70)
▶ Ton : Man, now you've done it. (0:03:31.24)
▶ Ton : You stabbed him? (0:03:33.61)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : You've gotta be kidding me... (0:03:33.95)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : It hurts... It hurts... (0:03:35.66)
▶ Chin : N-No! He walked right into my blade! (0:03:35.81)
▶ Ton : What are you doing? (0:03:41.49)
▶ Kan : Well, no sense in wasting it. (0:03:42.89)
▶ Kan : Take anything on him that's worth selling! (0:03:44.62)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : Huh? (0:03:45.82)
▶ Ton : Whoa, wait! The guards will be here any second! (0:03:46.85)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : But Old Man Rom ate those. (0:03:51.24)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : How? (0:03:54.11)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : C-Could... this be... (0:03:56.39)
▶ Chin : Run! We're in trouble! (0:03:59.78)
▶ Kadomon Risch : Well, boy? You want this appa? (0:04:12.96)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : Hey, mister... (0:04:16.50)
▶ Kadomon Risch : Huh? (0:04:18.19)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : How many times have you seen me now? (0:04:19.22)
▶ Kadomon Risch : What do you mean? I've never seen you before. (0:04:21.65)
▶ Kadomon Risch : Well? Are you buying it or not? (0:04:24.53)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : Sorry, but I'm broke beyond compare! (0:04:29.75)
▶ Kadomon Risch : Get the hell outta here! (0:04:32.93)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : Wallet, cell phone, corn potage snack, cup noodles. (0:04:35.63)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : My tracksuit and sneakers are intact, too. (0:04:39.29)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : And naturally... (0:04:42.34)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : Thank god. A wound to the back
is a warrior's greatest shame. (0:04:46.32)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : Well, with so much circumstantial
evidence, there's no denying it. (0:04:52.98)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : It's kinda hard to believe, but this has to be... (0:04:58.00)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : A time leap. (0:05:01.83)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : And each time, I return to my initial state. (0:05:03.27)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : I'll call it (0:05:06.15)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : "Return by Death." (0:05:07.64)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : I actually get a time-leap ability,
and it only activates when I die. (0:05:14.37)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : The precondition being pitiful is so typical. (0:05:18.69)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : If I've gone back in time, Satella hasn't
helped me in this fourth life. (0:05:22.07)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : Meaning the debt I owed her for saving me is gone. (0:05:28.28)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : In that case, I should forget everything, sell this, (0:05:32.79)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : save some funds, and use my knowledge
of the modern world to live in luxury! (0:05:37.13)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : My dream is taking shape before my eyes! (0:05:41.55)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : Right, mister? (0:05:43.91)
▶ EXTRA : Wh-Why are you asking me? (0:05:45.38)
▶ EXTRA : I have no idea what you're talking about. (0:05:47.46)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : Aw, that's cold... (0:05:50.32)
▶ EXTRA : I don't wanna get caught up
in other people's problems. (0:05:52.40)
▶ EXTRA : Don't talk to me. (0:05:55.71)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : Well, I guess "Let sleeping dogs
lie," applies in any world. (0:05:58.59)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : But still, there are always softies (0:06:04.97)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : who help others, even when
they really can't afford to... (0:06:08.32)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : She'd just had something precious stolen. (0:06:12.01)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : She didn't have time for me. (0:06:14.16)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : Yet she saved some useless stranger, (0:06:16.45)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : and even healed him. (0:06:18.87)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : Then she let that useless stranger
be pleased with himself... (0:06:20.77)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : Even if Satella doesn't know me, (0:06:49.72)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : Felt still stole her insignia. And Elsa will... (0:06:53.79)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : No matter how many times I repeat
this, that won't change. (0:06:58.75)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : They say history repeats itself, right? (0:07:01.82)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : Yeah. (0:07:10.85)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : If I have knowledge that people
I used to know will be killed, (0:07:11.93)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : I can't just ignore it! (0:07:17.73)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : Hey, mister... (0:07:24.92)
▶ Kadomon Risch : What do you want, broke kid? (0:07:26.84)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : There's something I want to ask you... (0:07:29.13)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : Have there been any pickpocketing
incidents around here? (0:07:31.56)
▶ Kadomon Risch : Asking questions, without buying anything?
You really do have guts. (0:07:34.38)
▶ Kadomon Risch : Incidents like that aren't uncommon at all. (0:07:38.85)
▶ Kadomon Risch : Though, that last one was unusual... (0:07:41.65)
▶ Kadomon Risch : They threw some magic around
in the street a few times. (0:07:45.14)
▶ Kadomon Risch : Things that looked like icicles flew
around and lodged in the wall. (0:07:48.07)
▶ Kadomon Risch : But they disappeared fast. (0:07:51.01)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : I'm too late? (0:07:52.49)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : I thought if I could keep the insignia
from being stolen, then maybe... (0:07:53.95)
▶ Kadomon Risch : Maybe what? (0:07:57.77)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : Oh, just talking to myself, but... (0:07:59.27)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : Thanks, mister... For telling me,
even though I didn't buy anything. (0:08:02.60)
▶ Kadomon Risch : It's no big deal. (0:08:06.63)
▶ Kadomon Risch : A broke kid, like you, just helped my
daughter after she got lost earlier. (0:08:08.59)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : I guess fate is a compelling force, too... (0:08:14.71)
▶ Kadomon Risch : What are you smiling about? (0:08:19.15)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : Nothing. (0:08:20.60)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : I'll buy an appa next time! (0:08:22.29)
▶ Kadomon Risch : Sure. Buy one, and you'll be a customer. (0:08:24.68)
▶ Kadomon Risch : Get to work, broke kid! (0:08:26.92)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : Right! (0:08:29.06)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : This means there's only one way. (0:08:30.93)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : Before Elsa comes to the loot house, (0:08:33.27)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : I have to buy the insignia from
Felt, and return it to Satella! (0:08:35.17)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : Wait... (0:08:38.09)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : Satella was just an alias, wasn't it? (0:08:38.93)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : Then I've gotta get her to tell
me her real name this time— (0:08:42.25)
▶ Kan : What are you babbling about? (0:08:49.83)
▶ Chin : If you don't wanna get hurt, cough up
whatever you've got! (0:08:52.09)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : I'm getting sick of seeing your faces,
Larry, Moe, and Curly. (0:08:55.28)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : After doing this four times,
I've learned my lesson! (0:08:58.77)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : Guards! (0:09:08.74)
▶ Kan : What the hell, you bastard?! (0:09:10.74)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : My memory from before was right. (0:09:13.46)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : This world does have some kind of police force! (0:09:15.86)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : Someone! P-Please, I need a man! (0:09:19.30)
▶ Chin : Damn it, shut up! (0:09:22.97)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : No, don't touch me... Stop. (0:09:23.94)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : I can't hear you. You're not being sincere enough. (0:09:25.94)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : Police... Huh? (0:09:29.09)
▶ Ton : Don't scare me like that. (0:09:33.61)
▶ Ton : I might have freaked out, just a little. (0:09:35.23)
▶ Chin : Just a little bit. (0:09:37.87)
▶ Kan : Just a tiny, little bit. (0:09:39.51)
▶ Kan : Trying to run won't help you. (0:09:43.12)
▶ Reinhard van Astrea : That's enough. (0:09:46.97)
▶ Ton : Red hair. (0:09:53.30)
▶ Ton : And a knight's sword, with scratches
made by dragon claws. (0:09:55.14)
▶ Ton : It can't be. (0:09:58.28)
▶ Ton : Reinhard? (0:09:59.63)
▶ Ton : The master swordsman, Reinhard? (0:10:01.10)
▶ Reinhard van Astrea : Seems I needn't introduce myself. (0:10:03.33)
▶ Reinhard van Astrea : Although, that nickname is a bit much. (0:10:06.24)
▶ Reinhard van Astrea : I don't know how much my modest
strength could aid him. (0:10:09.78)
▶ Reinhard van Astrea : But if you wish to resort to extreme measures, (0:10:13.19)
▶ Reinhard van Astrea : as a knight, I would have to fight back. (0:10:15.85)
▶ Ton : S-Screw this! It's not worth it! (0:10:19.50)
▶ Reinhard van Astrea : I'm glad we're both safe. Are you unhurt? (0:10:27.14)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : A-Allow me to thank you, from the bottom
of my heart, for saving my life! (0:10:33.05)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : I, Natsuki Subaru,
deeply admire your selflessness! (0:10:38.51)
▶ Reinhard van Astrea : No need for such formality. (0:10:42.88)
▶ Reinhard van Astrea : Once it was three against two,
they lost their advantage. (0:10:45.57)
▶ Reinhard van Astrea : If I'd been alone, it would have been different. (0:10:50.05)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : H-His nice-guy index is off the charts. (0:10:52.23)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : Uh... Reinhard-san, right? (0:10:58.17)
▶ Reinhard van Astrea : You may just call me "Reinhard," Subaru. (0:11:02.17)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : He closed our distance like it was nothing... (0:11:05.32)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : Well, thanks again, Reinhard. (0:11:07.86)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : You're the only one who heard me
shouting and came to help... (0:11:10.51)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : Talk about lonely. (0:11:14.03)
▶ Reinhard van Astrea : For most, it's too risky to face off
against people like them. (0:11:16.39)
▶ Reinhard van Astrea : As far as it goes, you were
right to call for the guards. (0:11:21.09)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : Are you a guard? (0:11:25.94)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : You don't look like one... (0:11:28.91)
▶ Reinhard van Astrea : I'm off duty today, so I'm not in uniform. (0:11:30.98)
▶ Reinhard van Astrea : And I realize that I don't appear
particularly intimidating. (0:11:33.94)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : Come to think of it, didn't they
call you a master swordsman? (0:11:37.90)
▶ Reinhard van Astrea : My family is fairly unique. (0:11:41.71)
▶ Reinhard van Astrea : Every day, I feel I'll be crushed
by their expectations. (0:11:44.22)
▶ Reinhard van Astrea : Anyway, Subaru... (0:11:48.91)
▶ Reinhard van Astrea : You have quite the unusual
hair, apparel, and name. (0:11:50.26)
▶ Reinhard van Astrea : What nation are you from? (0:11:53.86)
▶ Reinhard van Astrea : At the moment, Lugunica is a bit
more restive than in peacetime. (0:11:56.11)
▶ Reinhard van Astrea : If you have a problem, I'd be glad to help you. (0:12:00.11)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : Would you come to the loot house? (0:12:04.25)
▶ Reinhard van Astrea : The loot house? (0:12:05.81)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : N-Never mind... Forget it. (0:12:08.34)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : I can't trouble you with that... (0:12:12.96)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : I'll handle the rest on my own, somehow. (0:12:15.23)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : But... I'd appreciate it if you
could deliver a message. (0:12:18.92)
▶ Reinhard van Astrea : I'd be glad to, of course. (0:12:22.96)
▶ Reinhard van Astrea : To whom? And what? (0:12:24.75)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : Well, I don't know her name, but... (0:12:26.95)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : Have you seen a girl with white
robes and silver hair nearby? (0:12:30.69)
▶ Reinhard van Astrea : White robes and silver hair? (0:12:34.81)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : She's also extremely gorgeous! (0:12:37.32)
▶ Reinhard van Astrea : No, I haven't. (0:12:41.21)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : Then, if you do see her, (0:12:43.20)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : tell her not to go near the loot
house, no matter what. (0:12:45.32)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : I'll find what she's looking for
and bring it to her myself. (0:12:49.13)
▶ Reinhard van Astrea : Very well. If I see her,
I shall relay your message. (0:12:53.70)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : Thanks. (0:12:57.74)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : I'll repay you one day! (0:13:00.34)
▶ Reinhard van Astrea : All right. (0:13:02.60)
▶ Reinhard van Astrea : Take care. (0:13:04.28)
▶ EXTRA : Felt's den? (0:13:09.00)
▶ EXTRA : Yeah, just go two streets down that way. (0:13:11.35)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : Thanks, I appreciate it, bro. (0:13:14.58)
▶ EXTRA : Don't mention it, bro. Live strong. (0:13:17.01)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : The question is whether Felt will return there... (0:13:21.25)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : I'd rather catch her before she
goes to the loot house, (0:13:24.55)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : and trade her the cell phone for the insignia— (0:13:27.60)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : Whoa! (0:13:30.51)
▶ Elsa Granhiert : Oh, dear! (0:13:31.51)
▶ Elsa Granhiert : I'm sorry. Are you all right? (0:13:32.49)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : Yeah, I'm fine. (0:13:34.39)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : I don't look it, but toughness
is one thing I... have... (0:13:36.00)
▶ Elsa Granhiert : What's wrong? (0:13:48.52)
▶ Elsa Granhiert : You don't have to be so scared.
I won't do anything to you. (0:13:49.77)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : I... I'm not scared... (0:13:53.60)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : What gave you that idea? (0:13:56.46)
▶ Elsa Granhiert : Your scent. (0:13:58.22)
▶ Elsa Granhiert : When people are scared, I can smell their fear. (0:13:59.49)
▶ Elsa Granhiert : Right now, you're frightened. (0:14:05.06)
▶ Elsa Granhiert : You're also angry, aren't you? (0:14:07.27)
▶ Elsa Granhiert : At me. (0:14:10.20)
▶ Elsa Granhiert : It's fine. (0:14:19.81)
▶ Elsa Granhiert : I'm a little curious, but this isn't
the time to start a commotion. (0:14:21.65)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : That's not a very nice thing to say... (0:14:25.78)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : If you're too scary,
that beauty will go to waste— (0:14:28.07)
▶ Elsa Granhiert : Oh, very good. (0:14:30.60)
▶ Elsa Granhiert : Conceal your hostility,
and you'll be even better. (0:14:32.25)
▶ Elsa Granhiert : Well, I'll be going now. (0:14:37.38)
▶ Elsa Granhiert : Something tells me we'll meet again. (0:14:39.69)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : Someone actually lives here? (0:14:57.81)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : Elsa hasn't already been here
and trashed it, has she? (0:15:03.30)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : I-It's fine, I'm sure... (0:15:08.00)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : I don't smell blood. (0:15:10.09)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : But it does smell like garbage. (0:15:11.64)
▶ Felt : What do you think you're doing,
peeking into someone's house? (0:15:15.22)
▶ Felt : Sorry, but there's nothing worth stealing in there. (0:15:19.46)
▶ Felt : Beat it! (0:15:22.98)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : No, wait! That's not what I was doing... (0:15:24.22)
▶ Felt : Shut up! Don't argue! (0:15:26.18)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : Whoa, stop... (0:15:26.84)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : Calm down! This is no time to fight! (0:15:28.37)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : Before it gets dark— (0:15:30.40)
▶ Felt : Before it gets dark, you'd better be gone. (0:15:33.03)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : I told you, you've got it all wrong... (0:15:35.44)
▶ Felt : You don't give up, do you? (0:15:48.78)
▶ Felt : I told you to get out of here! (0:15:50.85)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : Just listen to me! (0:15:53.32)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : P-Please! Just hear me out, Felt! (0:16:11.60)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : I came to see you on important business! (0:16:15.36)
▶ Felt : How do you know my name? (0:16:17.56)
▶ Felt : You want me to steal something for you? (0:16:19.67)
▶ Felt : You should have said that first! (0:16:21.63)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : You're the one who attacked me right away. (0:16:23.19)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : You know, this is a greedy business you're running! (0:16:25.92)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : Do you pride yourself on sticky fingers? (0:16:27.90)
▶ Felt : It's all a matter of how to stay alive. (0:16:29.60)
▶ Felt : If it weren't this, I'd have no
choice but to sell my body. (0:16:31.59)
▶ Felt : So, what's your business with me? (0:16:34.28)
▶ Felt : Spit it out. (0:16:36.12)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : There's one thing I want. (0:16:38.26)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : Here and now, I want to buy the insignia you stole! (0:16:39.95)
▶ Felt : You aren't associated with my client. (0:16:42.87)
▶ Felt : Are you a business rival? (0:16:46.23)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : Call her a rival, or call her the
one who killed my parents... (0:16:48.31)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : Or even the one who killed me! (0:16:51.90)
▶ Felt : You make no sense. (0:16:54.14)
▶ Felt : Well, I'm only interested in selling
to whoever pays most. (0:16:55.85)
▶ Felt : If you've got an offer that might
be profitable, I'll listen. (0:17:00.47)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : Very shrewd... (0:17:03.73)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : I have something worth more
than twenty holy coins. (0:17:06.02)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : I want to buy your insignia with it. (0:17:10.08)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : It's what everyone wants these days, a metia. (0:17:12.84)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : That is the power of a metia! (0:17:18.99)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : It's a one-of-a-kind item that can capture
and stop a moment in time. (0:17:21.18)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : So, how about it? (0:17:26.10)
▶ Felt : You don't seem to be lying. (0:17:28.12)
▶ Felt : But that's supposed to be me?
I'm way prettier. (0:17:30.51)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : If you look this good without makeup,
you're doing fine... (0:17:33.70)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : Don't complain. (0:17:36.48)
▶ Felt : Well, it is unusual. I'll give you that. (0:17:37.68)
▶ Felt : But twenty holy coins? Not likely. (0:17:40.47)
▶ Felt : I'm not so stupid as to believe, without question, (0:17:43.71)
▶ Felt : everything a prospective buyer says. (0:17:46.89)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : Well, of course not. (0:17:50.25)
▶ Felt : At the far edge of the slums is a loot house. (0:17:52.82)
▶ Felt : The fair thing is to have the codger who
lives there, Old Man Rom, appraise it. (0:17:55.38)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : So it still comes to that... (0:18:01.20)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : Okay, got it. Let's go. (0:18:03.57)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : Right now... Let's move. (0:18:05.59)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : On the double! (0:18:07.13)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : We'll have him take a look,
and get right out of there! (0:18:08.43)
▶ Felt : Hey, hey! (0:18:12.03)
▶ Felt : What's your problem? (0:18:16.69)
▶ Felt : Why are you in such a hurry? (0:18:18.41)
▶ Felt : You're soaked with sweat. (0:18:23.80)
▶ Felt : Live strong. (0:18:26.66)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : Everyone in the slums says that. (0:18:28.68)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : Is it some kind of slogan? (0:18:31.16)
▶ Felt : Don't lump me in with those guys! (0:18:32.49)
▶ Felt : They're all talk. They aren't strong at all. (0:18:34.74)
▶ Felt : They're just a bunch of
stingy losers at life. (0:18:37.44)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : That's a bit harsh... (0:18:41.30)
▶ Felt : I'm not like the people here. (0:18:48.19)
▶ Felt : I have no intention of living out
my life in these back alleys! (0:18:50.88)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : And you think twenty holy coins will
make your dream come true? (0:18:55.99)
▶ Felt : It's true that it'd be a
huge leap toward my goal. (0:19:01.18)
▶ Felt : Even if I were alone, it isn't as
if I couldn't get by with effort. (0:19:04.43)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : If you were alone? (0:19:08.63)
▶ Felt : Never mind... (0:19:10.14)
▶ Felt : What are you smirking about? (0:19:18.25)
▶ Felt : You really piss me off! (0:19:20.39)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : Don't worry about it. (0:19:22.27)
▶ Felt : H-Hey, what're you doing? Stop! (0:19:24.14)
▶ Felt : Hey! (0:19:26.93)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : Just gotta make it work, huh? (0:19:27.93)
▶ Felt : I said, "Stop!" (0:19:28.83)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : And only I can do that. (0:19:30.34)
▶ Felt : Don't get all sentimental and babble nonsense! (0:19:31.84)
▶ Felt : I'll bite you! (0:19:35.21)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : It isn't only for her. (0:19:36.37)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : I'll change the fate that's waiting for me. (0:19:38.34)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : And to do that, I'll... (0:19:41.15)
▶ Felt : I told you to cut it out! (0:19:42.53)
▶ Rom : So this is a metia... (0:19:54.90)
▶ Rom : Even I've never seen one before. (0:19:56.82)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : It's fairly delicate, so handle it with care. (0:19:59.94)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : Think along the lines of, "If you
break it, you have to die," (0:20:03.45)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : like no do-overs. (0:20:07.01)
▶ Rom : Yeah, I'm definitely impressed. (0:20:09.03)
▶ Rom : If I were to sell this, I'd take no less than fifteen... no, twenty holy coins. (0:20:12.36)
▶ Rom : It's worth at least that. (0:20:19.56)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : All right! Negotiations complete! (0:20:21.43)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : Now, if we're done talking, let's go for
drinks to celebrate a completed sale! (0:20:24.88)
▶ Felt : Hold it! (0:20:30.85)
▶ Felt : Why are you in such a hurry? (0:20:33.30)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : Life doesn't last forever. (0:20:37.63)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : Make every second count. Don't waste any— (0:20:40.03)
▶ Felt : Yeah, yeah! (0:20:42.52)
▶ Felt : I don't care about all that. (0:20:43.36)
▶ Felt : Why do you even want the insignia, anyway? (0:20:45.13)
▶ Felt : This insignia is worth a lot more than it looks. (0:20:49.43)
▶ Felt : That's why everyone wants it. (0:20:54.59)
▶ Felt : In other words, this would sell
for more than a metia— (0:20:57.05)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : Hang on, Felt! That's a dangerous way to think! (0:21:00.48)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : He appraised it at over twenty holy coins. (0:21:03.62)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : Just sell it for that! Don't ask for more! (0:21:05.72)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : El— The woman who asked you for it
can't go higher than twenty, either. (0:21:09.23)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : She won't pay more than that! (0:21:13.59)
▶ Felt : How do you know that? (0:21:17.49)
▶ Felt : You just admitted that you're with them. (0:21:21.13)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : I don't have time... Please, Felt! (0:21:26.44)
▶ Felt : Begging won't help. (0:21:29.11)
▶ Felt : I acknowledge you as a negotiating party. (0:21:31.49)
▶ Felt : But not hearing what my client
says wouldn't be fair. (0:21:34.28)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : The reason I want that insignia (0:21:39.08)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : is so I can return it to its owner. (0:21:43.17)
▶ Felt : Huh? (0:21:45.64)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : I want to return it to its owner! (0:21:46.34)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : That's why I want the insignia! (0:21:49.05)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : That's all! So please! (0:21:50.74)
▶ Rom : Felt, it doesn't look to me like the boy's lying. (0:21:55.32)
▶ Felt : Don't get taken in by him. (0:22:00.36)
▶ Felt : He's obviously joking around. (0:22:02.42)
▶ Felt : Return it to the owner? Ridiculous! (0:22:04.26)
▶ Felt : If you're gonna lie, make it believable! (0:22:06.90)
▶ Felt : I won't be fooled! (0:22:09.13)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : Felt... (0:22:14.77)
▶ Rom : Who's that? (0:22:18.69)
▶ Felt : It might be for me. (0:22:19.81)
▶ Felt : It's a little early, though. (0:22:21.68)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : Don't open it! (0:22:29.48)
▶ Subaru Natsuki : W-We'll be killed! (0:22:31.29)
▶ Emilia : Kill you? I wouldn't do something so terrifying. (0:22:49.28)
▶ EXTRA : Reunion with the Witch (0:23:00.81)
