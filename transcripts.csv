 Emilia | It's getting lonelier and lonelier. 
 Subaru Natsuki | This is bad... Very bad... 
 Emilia | Subaru? What's wrong? 
 Subaru Natsuki | Ah, I see. This is where they suck you in. 
 Subaru Natsuki | No... Run! Hurry! 
 EXTRA | Miso Natto 
 Subaru Natsuki | Nah, not natto. 
 Subaru Natsuki | Wait there... 
 EXTRA | That'll be 363 yen. 
 Subaru Natsuki | Oh, a grooved-edge ten. 
 Subaru Natsuki | I'm... 
 Subaru Natsuki | going to... 
 Subaru Natsuki | save you... 
 Subaru Natsuki |" I guess anyone's eyes would be tired after
holing up in their room, gaming all day. "
 Subaru Natsuki | What's going on? 
 Subaru Natsuki | This stuff obviously isn't fake. 
 Subaru Natsuki | Which means... 
 Subaru Natsuki | So does this mean... 
 Subaru Natsuki | I've been summoned into a parallel world?! 
 Subaru Natsuki | I guess I can assume this is a fantasy world 
 Subaru Natsuki | with the typical medieval-style culture. 
 Subaru Natsuki | A realm where demihumans are commonplace, 
 Subaru Natsuki |" and probably stuff like wars
and adventures, as well. "
 Subaru Natsuki | And here, I'm... 
 EXTRA | Hey! 
 EXTRA | Watch out! 
 Subaru Natsuki | This is it! It's my turn! 
 Subaru Natsuki |" This must be the event where
I produce my first magic! "
 EXTRA | Look out! 
 EXTRA | Way to go! 
 EXTRA | Well done! 
 Subaru Natsuki | I guess I'm not quite ready to use magic... 
 Subaru Natsuki | I can't read this. 
 Kadomon Risch | Hey, boy. 
 Kadomon Risch |" Those are some weird clothes.
Are you traveling? "
 Subaru Natsuki | What are these? 
 Kadomon Risch | Those are appas. 
 Subaru Natsuki |" They understand me, though.
The question is... "
 Kadomon Risch | Huh? What kind of money is that? 
 Kadomon Risch | You can't use that stuff in Lugunica. 
 Kadomon Risch | That means you're flat broke, huh? 
 Kadomon Risch |" Get outta here!
Don't interfere with my business! "
 Subaru Natsuki | There's no other way... 
 Subaru Natsuki |" I'll just have to go around
gathering information first. "
 EXTRA | This place is for demihumans only. 
 Subaru Natsuki | Ow! I can't... see... 
 Subaru Natsuki | Is this how it's supposed to be? 
 Subaru Natsuki | Wasn't I summoned into a parallel world?! 
 Subaru Natsuki | Where'd my protagonist status go?! 
 Subaru Natsuki | Damn it. 
 EXTRA | [Phone Menu] 
 EXTRA | [Contacts] 
 Subaru Natsuki | My cell phone still works... 
 EXTRA | Out of Range 
 Subaru Natsuki | But what's the point in having it?! 
 Subaru Natsuki | And my starting gear is way too wimpy! 
 Subaru Natsuki | You need a more substantial welfare program 
 Subaru Natsuki |" to satisfy pressure-free
generation kids like me! "
 Subaru Natsuki | I don't even have Excalibur or anything! 
 Subaru Natsuki |" And besides, if I was summoned,
where's the cute girl who summoned me? "
 Subaru Natsuki |" Did she summon me only
to leave me here alone? "
 Subaru Natsuki |" Hey, is she finally here?!
The cute girl who summoned... me... "
 Kan | What are you babbling about? 
 Chin |" If you don't wanna get hurt,
cough up whatever you've got! "
 Subaru Natsuki | Crap, it's a compulsory event... 
 Felt | Move it, move it! 
 Felt | You guys! 
 Felt | Out of my way! 
 Subaru Natsuki | Here we go! 
 Subaru Natsuki | Is that the cute girl who summoned me?! 
 Felt |" Summoned? I dunno what you're
talkin' about, but I'm busy! "
 Felt | Sorry! Live strong! 
 Subaru Natsuki | Wait, what? What?! 
 Subaru Natsuki |" Hey, that didn't make you decide to be less
hostile toward me, by any chance, did it? "
 Ton |" Actually, it rained on our
parade and made things worse. "
 Subaru Natsuki | Yeah, of course... 
 Subaru Natsuki | Just calm down, Natsuki Subaru. 
 Subaru Natsuki | Since ancient times, it's the rule that anyone 
 Subaru Natsuki |" summoned into a parallel world
will display supernatural powers! "
 Subaru Natsuki |" I'll mow these guys down and make
them fuel for my shining future! "
 Subaru Natsuki | You lumps of EXP! 
 Subaru Natsuki | That's the first time I ever hit someone! 
 Subaru Natsuki | I didn't expect it to hurt me that much... 
 Subaru Natsuki |" But this world is set up
so that I'll be strong! "
 Subaru Natsuki | My adrenaline is surging! I've got this! 
 Subaru Natsuki |" I'm sorry! It was all my fault!
Forgive me! Spare me! "
 Kan | Play games with us, will you?! Die, scum! 
 Chin | And don't think it'll be painless! 
 Emilia | That's enough. 
 Chin | Who the hell are you?! 
 Emilia | Stop now, and I'll let this slide. 
 Emilia | So just graciously return what you stole. 
 Ton | What we stole? 
 Emilia | Now, please. It's important to me. 
 Emilia |" I'll give up on the other stuff,
but I can't let you have that. "
 Emilia | Be good and hand it over, please. 
 Ton | You didn't come to save this kid? 
 Emilia | What strange clothes he has... 
 Emilia |" If you asked me whether I had any
connection to him, I'd have to say no. "
 Ton | Then you've got no business with us! 
 Ton |" If someone stole from you,
it was that brat who just ran by! "
 Kan | Yeah! That way! She ran that way! 
 Emilia | Hmm... They don't seem to be lying... 
 Emilia | I need to go after her! 
 Emilia | But regardless of that... 
 Emilia | I can't overlook what's going on here. 
 Subaru Natsuki | Magic? 
 Chin | Mess with us, will you?! 
 Chin |" I don't care if you can
use magic! I'll kill you! "
 Chin |" You think you can win when
it's two against one?! Huh?! "
 Emilia | You're right. Two against one may be unfair. 
 Puck | Two against two should make it fair, then. 
 Ton | You're a user of the spiritual arts? 
 Emilia |" Correct. Back off now and
I won't come after you. "
 Emilia | Decide quick. I'm in a hurry. 
 Chin |" You bitch! Next time I see
you, I won't go easy on you! "
 Puck |" Do anything to her, and I'll
haunt you and your kin forever. "
 Puck | Not that you'll have any kin if I do that. 
 Subaru Natsuki | You saved me. Thanks. 
 Emilia | Don't move. 
 Emilia |" See? You averted your eyes because
you have a guilty conscience! "
 Emilia | Looks like my judgment was spot-on. 
 Puck | Are you sure? 
 Puck |" I think it was just an
instinctive male reaction. "
 Puck | I didn't sense any malice at all. 
 Emilia | You be quiet, Puck. 
 Emilia |" You know who stole my insignia
from me, don't you? "
 Subaru Natsuki |" Uh, sorry, but I don't
have the slightest idea. "
 Emilia | Huh? Wait, it can't be! 
 Emilia | Did I really just come around the long way? 
 Subaru Natsuki | You should probably hurry after her, miss. 
 Subaru Natsuki | I could... help... 
 Puck | Aww, you shouldn't have tried to get up. 
 Puck | What should we do? 
 Emilia | It's none of our business. 
 Emilia | He won't die. We'll just leave him. 
 Puck | Really? 
 Emilia | Yes, really. 
 Puck |" You say that, but I bet
you'll still help him. "
 Emilia | I will not! 
 Puck | Yeah, right. 
 Emilia | Absolutely not! I am not going to save him! 
 Subaru Natsuki | She's even super cute when she's mad. 
 Subaru Natsuki | That's a parallel world fantasy for you... 
 Subaru Natsuki | Is my head on someone's lap? 
 Emilia | You're awake? 
 Subaru Natsuki | I didn't know cute girls were this hairy... 
 Subaru Natsuki | Wait, that can't be right! 
 Puck | It's just a thoughtful arrangement we made 
 Puck |" so you could at least feel
happy until you woke up. "
 Subaru Natsuki | First of all, don't talk in that high voice! 
 Subaru Natsuki |" No sane guy confuses a cat
for the main heroine! "
 Puck |" Aww, making myself bigger was
worth it to see you so happy. "
 Subaru Natsuki | I'm not happy! 
 Subaru Natsuki | I'm sorry about this. 
 Subaru Natsuki |" You stayed with me the whole
time I was unconscious... "
 Emilia | Don't get the wrong idea. 
 Emilia |" I had to stay because there
are things I want to ask you. "
 Emilia |" Healing your wounds and making Puck
your pillow until you woke up "
 Emilia | were for my own benefit. 
 Emilia | So I need you to repay me in kind. 
 Subaru Natsuki |" For such a normal favor, you're making
it sound like I really owe you big. "
 Emilia | No such thing. 
 Emilia |" You have some idea who
stole my insignia, right? "
 Subaru Natsuki | Insignia? 
 Subaru Natsuki |" You mean one of those badge things
that shows your affiliation? "
 Emilia | It has a jewel in the center, 
 Emilia | and it's about this big. 
 Subaru Natsuki |" Sorry, but no matter how many
times you ask me, I have no idea. "
 Emilia | I see. No helping that, then. 
 Emilia |" But you've given me the information
that you know nothing, "
 Emilia |" and you gave me my answer,
in return for healing you. "
 Subaru Natsuki | Huh? 
 Emilia | Well, I'm in a hurry, so I'm going now. 
 Emilia | Your wounds should be better now, 
 Emilia |" but next time, don't do dangerous things,
like wandering into deserted alleys alone. "
 Emilia | I'm not concerned. I'm just warning you. 
 Emilia |" If that happens to you again,
saving you won't be of any benefit to me, "
 Emilia | so don't expect me to help. 
 Puck | Sorry about her. She's so insincere. 
 Puck | Don't think badly of her. 
 Subaru Natsuki | Insincere? 
 Subaru Natsuki | I think this goes beyond that. 
 Subaru Natsuki |" She was in such a hurry to find
what was stolen from her, "
 Subaru Natsuki | yet she stopped to help me. 
 Subaru Natsuki |" And she even came up with that lame excuse
for a favor so I wouldn't feel like I owed her, "
 Subaru Natsuki | even though I'm a total stranger. 
 Subaru Natsuki | Anyone who lives like that... 
 Subaru Natsuki | is gonna end up wasting their whole life! 
 Subaru Natsuki | Hey! Wait up! 
 Emilia |" What? Just so you know, I can only spend
just a little more time with you. "
 Subaru Natsuki | I sense you're being a tiny bit lenient... 
 Subaru Natsuki |" Forget that. You lost
something important, right? "
 Subaru Natsuki | Let me help you. 
 Emilia | But you said you don't know anything... 
 Subaru Natsuki | But I remember her face, at least! 
 Subaru Natsuki | If I see her again, I'll know! 
 Emilia | You're very strange... 
 Emilia |" Just so you know, I can't
do anything to thank you. "
 Subaru Natsuki | I don't need you to. 
 Subaru Natsuki |" I want to thank you.
That's why I want to help. "
 Emilia | I didn't do anything deserving of thanks. 
 Emilia |" I told you, I've already received
compensation for healing your wounds. "
 Subaru Natsuki | Then... 
 Subaru Natsuki | I'm going to help you for my own sake, too. 
 Subaru Natsuki | My objective is... Let's see... 
 Subaru Natsuki | Yeah! One good deed per day! 
 Puck |" I don't sense any malice. I think
you can just accept his offer. "
 Puck |" The more shields between yourself and
ruffians, the better, after all. "
 Subaru Natsuki | That's what you want me around for?! 
 Emilia |" I mean it, though.
I can't do anything to thank you. "
 Subaru Natsuki | No problem. Just leave it to me! 
 Subaru Natsuki |" I talked big, but isn't this town too
huge to find one little thing in? "
 Emilia | It's the capital of Lugunica. 
 Emilia | You didn't even know that, um... 
 Puck |" That's right. We haven't
asked your name yet. "
 Puck | Should we all introduce ourselves? 
 Subaru Natsuki | Oh, yeah, you're right. 
 Subaru Natsuki | I'll introduce myself first, then. 
 Subaru Natsuki | My name is Natsuki Subaru. 
 Subaru Natsuki |" Not only am I clueless,
I'm also broke beyond compare! "
 Subaru Natsuki | Nice to meet ya! 
 Puck |" When that's all you say,
you really do sound hopeless. "
 Puck | And I'm Puck! Nice to meet you! 
 Emilia |" It's very unusual to see someone who
can touch a spirit so casually. "
 Emilia | Where are you from? 
 Subaru Natsuki |" Well, following the usual pattern,
a small island nation to the east. "
 Emilia |" Lugunica is the easternmost
nation on our continental map. "
 Emilia | There's no nation east of here. 
 Subaru Natsuki |" No way, really?
There's nothing east of here? "
 Emilia |" You have no idea where you
are, you have no money, "
 Emilia |" you can't read, and you have
no one who can help you. "
 Emilia |" You might be in an even more
precarious position than me, um... "
 Emilia | Subaru... was it? 
 Subaru Natsuki | Yes, that's my name. 
 Puck |" But when I look at you this way,
you look pretty well-built. "
 Subaru Natsuki | I do work out every day. 
 Subaru Natsuki |" For a shut-in who's gotta guard
his house, that much is a given. "
 Emilia |" I'm not sure I understand
what a ""shut-in"" is, "
 Emilia |" but that means you're from a
respectable family, right? "
 Subaru Natsuki | H-Hey— 
 Emilia | Your fingers, too. They're very pretty. 
 Emilia |" They're evidence that you don't
live like a peasant at all. "
 Emilia |" And your muscles don't look like
the kind you gain by working. "
 Subaru Natsuki | Uh, anyway, I know your cat's name now, 
 Subaru Natsuki | but I haven't heard yours yet. 
 Emilia | My name? 
 Subaru Natsuki | Yeah. 
 Emilia | I'm... 
 Emilia | Satella. 
 Emilia |" I have no family name.
You can just call me Satella. "
 Subaru Natsuki | I see... Satella... 
 Subaru Natsuki | That's a nice name. 
 Puck | You have terrible taste. 
 Subaru Natsuki | Okay, time to get back to asking around! 
 Emilia | Hey, Subaru... 
 Emilia | Do you get the feeling that child is lost? 
 Subaru Natsuki | Uh, but what about our questioning? 
 Emilia |" That's important too, but if she's
lost, we have to do something. "
 Subaru Natsuki | I'm in no place to talk after you saved me, 
 Subaru Natsuki | but do you understand the position we're in? 
 Emilia | But... 
 Emilia | She's crying! Is she not, Subaru? 
 Emilia | If you can't do this with me, that's fine. 
 Emilia | Thanks for all your help, Subaru. 
 Emilia | I'll handle it on my own from here, 
 Emilia | after I help that little girl. 
 Emilia | I'm sorry I'm not who you were looking for. 
 Emilia | So, what's the matter? 
 Emilia | Aren't your mom and dad with you? 
 Emilia | Um, uh... Don't cry... 
 Emilia | I won't do anything to you, okay? 
 Subaru Natsuki |" What I have here is one
grooved-edge ten-yen coin. "
 Subaru Natsuki | I will now clutch it tightly in my hand. 
 Subaru Natsuki | Tight, tight, tight... like that! 
 Subaru Natsuki | And now... Imagine that! 
 Subaru Natsuki | And this... is where the coin was hiding. 
 Subaru Natsuki | You can have this. 
 Subaru Natsuki | It's rare, so take good care of it. 
 EXTRA | Thank you! 
 Subaru Natsuki | I see. You got separated from your mom, huh? 
 Subaru Natsuki | Hey, it'll be fine. 
 Subaru Natsuki |" Just leave it to me and
this young lady here. "
 Subaru Natsuki | We'll find them for you in no time. 
 Subaru Natsuki | When we do this, 
 Subaru Natsuki |" people who don't know us probably think
we're a married couple and child, huh? "
 Subaru Natsuki | How embarrassing. 
 Emilia |" At best, I can't see you as anything
more than her older brother. "
 Subaru Natsuki |" What makes you think I'm that
much younger than you?! "
 EXTRA | Oh! Mommy! 
 EXTRA | Mommy! 
 Subaru Natsuki | Looks like she found her. 
 Emilia | Yeah. I'm glad. 
 Subaru Natsuki | So... 
 Subaru Natsuki | I think we took a pretty long way around, 
 Subaru Natsuki |" but what benefit will you insist
that you got out of this? "
 Emilia |" That's easy. Now we can continue our
search with our minds at ease, right? "
 Emilia | Anyway, why did you help me? 
 Emilia | You were against the idea. 
 Subaru Natsuki |" I could say I just wanted
to show off my magic trick, "
 Subaru Natsuki | but that would be a lie. 
 Subaru Natsuki |" I told you, finding your insignia will
be my one good deed for the day! "
 Emilia |" Then, since you helped the little girl,
isn't your one good deed over? "
 Subaru Natsuki | That comeback was way too logical! 
 Subaru Natsuki |" Come on, it doesn't hurt to do more
than one nice thing in a day, right? "
 Subaru Natsuki | I just got tomorrow's out of the way. 
 Subaru Natsuki |" My plan is to get a week's worth
of good deeds taken care of early! "
 Emilia |" Subaru, you're the type that basically
wastes your whole life, aren't you? "
 Subaru Natsuki |" You're the last one I
want saying that to me. "
 Emilia | You're not a bad boy, though. 
 Subaru Natsuki |" Why are you treating me like
I'm younger than you again? "
 Subaru Natsuki |" I doubt there's that much
difference between us. "
 Emilia |" I don't think making guesses
on that will help you. "
 Emilia | I'm a half-elf. 
 Subaru Natsuki | Now I get it. 
 Subaru Natsuki | No wonder I thought you were so cute! 
 Subaru Natsuki | Elves are always beautiful, right? 
 Subaru Natsuki | What? 
 Emilia |" ""What""? Well, I mean... I'm a half-elf... "
 Subaru Natsuki | Yeah, I heard you. 
 Subaru Natsuki | What'd you do that for? 
 Puck |" I just had to do something about
this unbearable tingle I feel! "
 Subaru Natsuki |" I can't accept being hit
for a reason like that. "
 Subaru Natsuki |" Though I'll forgive you
because it was squishy. "
 Puck | I didn't hit you out of anger or anything. 
 Puck | The opposite, in fact. 
 Emilia | Subaru, you're such a dunderhead! 
 Subaru Natsuki |" Dunderhead? Who says that
in this day and age? "
 Subaru Natsuki | And why are you insulting me? 
 Emilia | Hmph! Whatever! 
 Emilia |" More importantly, we have
to get back to the search. "
 Subaru Natsuki | Hey, hang on! 
 Subaru Natsuki |" Running around without
a plan never ends well. "
 Subaru Natsuki | There's a basic rule of searches. 
 Emilia | A basic rule of searches? 
 Subaru Natsuki |" Yep. You revisit the crime
scene a hundred times. "
 Subaru Natsuki | Where was your insignia stolen? 
 Subaru Natsuki |" So you see, it seems the crime
happened right around here, "
 Subaru Natsuki |" so I came back to this fruit stand after
valiantly telling her to leave it all to me. "
 Kadomon Risch |" What? I thought I had a customer,
but it's just the broke kid? "
 Subaru Natsuki | Do you really want to take that attitude? 
 Subaru Natsuki |" Haven't you noticed I'm
not who I was before? "
 Kadomon Risch | What? 
 Subaru Natsuki | Just look who I brought with me! 
 Subaru Natsuki |" I brought someone who just
might become a regular! "
 Emilia | Um, Subaru... 
 Emilia |" You seem to have some
weird expectations of me, "
 Emilia | but I don't have any money, either. 
 Subaru Natsuki | Huh?! Seriously? 
 Kadomon Risch |" So what did you want to say to me now
that I've got two broke customers, boy? "
 Subaru Natsuki | We're actually looking for someone, 
 Subaru Natsuki |" and we hoped we could ask
you some questions... "
 Kadomon Risch |" That was a sarcastic way of telling you I
don't have time for losers with no money! "
 Kadomon Risch | Get outta here! 
 EXTRA | Mister! 
 EXTRA | Thanks for your help earlier. 
 Subaru Natsuki | What brings you back here? 
 EXTRA |" It's my husband's shop,
so we were just stopping by. "
 Subaru Natsuki | Husband? 
 Kadomon Risch | Hey, there's my girl. 
 Kadomon Risch | Wait, you know these broke losers? 
 EXTRA | She got lost, and they found her. 
 EXTRA | Here, lady. 
 EXTRA | Please accept it. 
 EXTRA | She wants to thank you in her own way. 
 Emilia | Thank you. 
 Kadomon Risch | Sorry about that. 
 Kadomon Risch |" You helped my daughter,
and I want to thank you. "
 Kadomon Risch | You can ask for anything. 
 Emilia | There, you see? 
 Emilia |" That came back around
and worked in our favor! "
 Subaru Natsuki | The air, the atmosphere, and most likely, 
 Subaru Natsuki |" the attitudes of the people
living here are awful. "
 Subaru Natsuki | Are you sure she's here? 
 Kadomon Risch | It might be that Felt girl. 
 Kadomon Risch | You said a nimble little blond girl, right? 
 Kadomon Risch |" She's well-known in the slums.
Dunno where she lives, though. "
 Emilia | Maybe someone will tell us if we ask. 
 Puck |" No one would sell out one of their own,
so I don't think that would work. "
 Subaru Natsuki | Maybe we should come back later. 
 Puck |" Whether you stay or leave,
you should decide quickly. "
 Puck | I'm almost out of time. 
 Subaru Natsuki | You're what? Out of time? 
 Puck | I have a cute appearance, but I am a spirit. 
 Puck |" It take a lot of mana just
to appear in physical form. "
 Puck |" So at night, I return to
the crystal I was summoned from "
 Puck |" and prepare for the
emergence of the sun. "
 Puck |" On average, my ideal staying time
is from about nine to five. "
 Subaru Natsuki |" Nine to five? You sound
like a civil servant. "
 Subaru Natsuki |" Employment terms for spirits are
more severe than I thought... "
 Emilia |" We'll be fine without Puck.
We have to move forward. "
 Puck | Yeah. But, sorry... I'm at my limit... 
 Subaru Natsuki |" It's almost like he's dying
when he disappears... "
 Emilia | Sorry to work you so hard, Puck. 
 Emilia |" We'll handle things from
here, so get some rest. "
 Puck | Don't do anything reckless. 
 Puck |" If it comes down to it,
use the odo to summon me again. "
 Puck | Okay, take care of the rest, Subaru. 
 Subaru Natsuki |" Hey, I haven't been alone with a
girl since I was in grade school! "
 Emilia | Don't get any weird ideas. 
 Emilia | I can use magic. 
 Subaru Natsuki | I won't! 
 Subaru Natsuki |" The bigger issue is how
we should find Felt now. "
 Emilia | I'll ask the lesser spirits. 
 Subaru Natsuki | Lesser spirits? 
 Emilia |" Lesser spirits are beings that
haven't become spirits yet. "
 Emilia |" They grow over time, and when they
gain strength and self-awareness, "
 Emilia | they become full spirits, like Puck. 
 Emilia | I'll ask once more. 
 Emilia |" Why did you call me by the
name of the Jealous Witch? "
 Subaru Natsuki | Because you told me to. 
 Emilia | I don't know who told you that, 
 Emilia | but they have terrible taste! 
 Emilia | The Jealous Witch is the epitome of taboo, 
 Emilia |" and you call me by her name,
which most dare not even say! "
 EXTRA | That's right! 
 EXTRA | That's going too far, boy! 
 Emilia |" If you have nothing to say, I'm leaving.
I have things to do. "
 Subaru Natsuki | Felt! 
 Emilia | Were you stalling me? 
 Emilia | Are you working with her?! 
 Subaru Natsuki | N-No! 
 Subaru Natsuki | Hey... W-Wait a minute! 
 Subaru Natsuki | You have it all wrong! I'm... 
 Subaru Natsuki | Damn it! 
 Subaru Natsuki | Could someone just treat me a little nicer? 
 Subaru Natsuki | Why was I even... 
 Subaru Natsuki | summoned to this world? 
 Kan | What are you babbling about? 
 Chin |" If you don't wanna get hurt, cough up
whatever you've got! "
 Subaru Natsuki | Would you stop it already?! 
 Subaru Natsuki | No one is this damn persistent! 
 Chin | You think you can mouth off to us? 
 Subaru Natsuki | You're in my way! I have somewhere I have to go! 
 Ton | Man, now you've done it. 
 Ton | You stabbed him? 
 Subaru Natsuki | You've gotta be kidding me... 
 Subaru Natsuki | It hurts... It hurts... 
 Chin | N-No! He walked right into my blade! 
 Ton | What are you doing? 
 Kan | Well, no sense in wasting it. 
 Kan | Take anything on him that's worth selling! 
 Subaru Natsuki | Huh? 
 Ton | Whoa, wait! The guards will be here any second! 
 Subaru Natsuki | But Old Man Rom ate those. 
 Subaru Natsuki | How? 
 Subaru Natsuki | C-Could... this be... 
 Chin | Run! We're in trouble! 
 Kadomon Risch | Well, boy? You want this appa? 
 Subaru Natsuki | Hey, mister... 
 Kadomon Risch | Huh? 
 Subaru Natsuki | How many times have you seen me now? 
 Kadomon Risch | What do you mean? I've never seen you before. 
 Kadomon Risch | Well? Are you buying it or not? 
 Subaru Natsuki | Sorry, but I'm broke beyond compare! 
 Kadomon Risch | Get the hell outta here! 
 Subaru Natsuki | Wallet, cell phone, corn potage snack, cup noodles. 
 Subaru Natsuki | My tracksuit and sneakers are intact, too. 
 Subaru Natsuki | And naturally... 
 Subaru Natsuki |" Thank god. A wound to the back
is a warrior's greatest shame. "
 Subaru Natsuki |" Well, with so much circumstantial
evidence, there's no denying it. "
 Subaru Natsuki | It's kinda hard to believe, but this has to be... 
 Subaru Natsuki | A time leap. 
 Subaru Natsuki | And each time, I return to my initial state. 
 Subaru Natsuki | I'll call it 
 Subaru Natsuki |" ""Return by Death."" "
 Subaru Natsuki |" I actually get a time-leap ability,
and it only activates when I die. "
 Subaru Natsuki | The precondition being pitiful is so typical. 
 Subaru Natsuki |" If I've gone back in time, Satella hasn't
helped me in this fourth life. "
 Subaru Natsuki | Meaning the debt I owed her for saving me is gone. 
 Subaru Natsuki | In that case, I should forget everything, sell this, 
 Subaru Natsuki |" save some funds, and use my knowledge
of the modern world to live in luxury! "
 Subaru Natsuki | My dream is taking shape before my eyes! 
 Subaru Natsuki | Right, mister? 
 EXTRA | Wh-Why are you asking me? 
 EXTRA | I have no idea what you're talking about. 
 Subaru Natsuki | Aw, that's cold... 
 EXTRA |" I don't wanna get caught up
in other people's problems. "
 EXTRA | Don't talk to me. 
 Subaru Natsuki |" Well, I guess ""Let sleeping dogs
lie,"" applies in any world. "
 Subaru Natsuki | But still, there are always softies 
 Subaru Natsuki |" who help others, even when
they really can't afford to... "
 Subaru Natsuki | She'd just had something precious stolen. 
 Subaru Natsuki | She didn't have time for me. 
 Subaru Natsuki | Yet she saved some useless stranger, 
 Subaru Natsuki | and even healed him. 
 Subaru Natsuki |" Then she let that useless stranger
be pleased with himself... "
 Subaru Natsuki | Even if Satella doesn't know me, 
 Subaru Natsuki | Felt still stole her insignia. And Elsa will... 
 Subaru Natsuki |" No matter how many times I repeat
this, that won't change. "
 Subaru Natsuki | They say history repeats itself, right? 
 Subaru Natsuki | Yeah. 
 Subaru Natsuki |" If I have knowledge that people
I used to know will be killed, "
 Subaru Natsuki | I can't just ignore it! 
 Subaru Natsuki | Hey, mister... 
 Kadomon Risch | What do you want, broke kid? 
 Subaru Natsuki | There's something I want to ask you... 
 Subaru Natsuki |" Have there been any pickpocketing
incidents around here? "
 Kadomon Risch |" Asking questions, without buying anything?
You really do have guts. "
 Kadomon Risch | Incidents like that aren't uncommon at all. 
 Kadomon Risch | Though, that last one was unusual... 
 Kadomon Risch |" They threw some magic around
in the street a few times. "
 Kadomon Risch |" Things that looked like icicles flew
around and lodged in the wall. "
 Kadomon Risch | But they disappeared fast. 
 Subaru Natsuki | I'm too late? 
 Subaru Natsuki |" I thought if I could keep the insignia
from being stolen, then maybe... "
 Kadomon Risch | Maybe what? 
 Subaru Natsuki | Oh, just talking to myself, but... 
 Subaru Natsuki |" Thanks, mister... For telling me,
even though I didn't buy anything. "
 Kadomon Risch | It's no big deal. 
 Kadomon Risch |" A broke kid, like you, just helped my
daughter after she got lost earlier. "
 Subaru Natsuki | I guess fate is a compelling force, too... 
 Kadomon Risch | What are you smiling about? 
 Subaru Natsuki | Nothing. 
 Subaru Natsuki | I'll buy an appa next time! 
 Kadomon Risch | Sure. Buy one, and you'll be a customer. 
 Kadomon Risch | Get to work, broke kid! 
 Subaru Natsuki | Right! 
 Subaru Natsuki | This means there's only one way. 
 Subaru Natsuki | Before Elsa comes to the loot house, 
 Subaru Natsuki |" I have to buy the insignia from
Felt, and return it to Satella! "
 Subaru Natsuki | Wait... 
 Subaru Natsuki | Satella was just an alias, wasn't it? 
 Subaru Natsuki |" Then I've gotta get her to tell
me her real name this time— "
 Kan | What are you babbling about? 
 Chin |" If you don't wanna get hurt, cough up
whatever you've got! "
 Subaru Natsuki |" I'm getting sick of seeing your faces,
Larry, Moe, and Curly. "
 Subaru Natsuki |" After doing this four times,
I've learned my lesson! "
 Subaru Natsuki | Guards! 
 Kan | What the hell, you bastard?! 
 Subaru Natsuki | My memory from before was right. 
 Subaru Natsuki | This world does have some kind of police force! 
 Subaru Natsuki | Someone! P-Please, I need a man! 
 Chin | Damn it, shut up! 
 Subaru Natsuki | No, don't touch me... Stop. 
 Subaru Natsuki | I can't hear you. You're not being sincere enough. 
 Subaru Natsuki | Police... Huh? 
 Ton | Don't scare me like that. 
 Ton | I might have freaked out, just a little. 
 Chin | Just a little bit. 
 Kan | Just a tiny, little bit. 
 Kan | Trying to run won't help you. 
 Reinhard van Astrea | That's enough. 
 Ton | Red hair. 
 Ton |" And a knight's sword, with scratches
made by dragon claws. "
 Ton | It can't be. 
 Ton | Reinhard? 
 Ton | The master swordsman, Reinhard? 
 Reinhard van Astrea | Seems I needn't introduce myself. 
 Reinhard van Astrea | Although, that nickname is a bit much. 
 Reinhard van Astrea |" I don't know how much my modest
strength could aid him. "
 Reinhard van Astrea | But if you wish to resort to extreme measures, 
 Reinhard van Astrea | as a knight, I would have to fight back. 
 Ton | S-Screw this! It's not worth it! 
 Reinhard van Astrea | I'm glad we're both safe. Are you unhurt? 
 Subaru Natsuki |" A-Allow me to thank you, from the bottom
of my heart, for saving my life! "
 Subaru Natsuki |" I, Natsuki Subaru,
deeply admire your selflessness! "
 Reinhard van Astrea | No need for such formality. 
 Reinhard van Astrea |" Once it was three against two,
they lost their advantage. "
 Reinhard van Astrea | If I'd been alone, it would have been different. 
 Subaru Natsuki | H-His nice-guy index is off the charts. 
 Subaru Natsuki | Uh... Reinhard-san, right? 
 Reinhard van Astrea |" You may just call me ""Reinhard,"" Subaru. "
 Subaru Natsuki | He closed our distance like it was nothing... 
 Subaru Natsuki | Well, thanks again, Reinhard. 
 Subaru Natsuki |" You're the only one who heard me
shouting and came to help... "
 Subaru Natsuki | Talk about lonely. 
 Reinhard van Astrea |" For most, it's too risky to face off
against people like them. "
 Reinhard van Astrea |" As far as it goes, you were
right to call for the guards. "
 Subaru Natsuki | Are you a guard? 
 Subaru Natsuki | You don't look like one... 
 Reinhard van Astrea | I'm off duty today, so I'm not in uniform. 
 Reinhard van Astrea |" And I realize that I don't appear
particularly intimidating. "
 Subaru Natsuki |" Come to think of it, didn't they
call you a master swordsman? "
 Reinhard van Astrea | My family is fairly unique. 
 Reinhard van Astrea |" Every day, I feel I'll be crushed
by their expectations. "
 Reinhard van Astrea | Anyway, Subaru... 
 Reinhard van Astrea |" You have quite the unusual
hair, apparel, and name. "
 Reinhard van Astrea | What nation are you from? 
 Reinhard van Astrea |" At the moment, Lugunica is a bit
more restive than in peacetime. "
 Reinhard van Astrea | If you have a problem, I'd be glad to help you. 
 Subaru Natsuki | Would you come to the loot house? 
 Reinhard van Astrea | The loot house? 
 Subaru Natsuki | N-Never mind... Forget it. 
 Subaru Natsuki | I can't trouble you with that... 
 Subaru Natsuki | I'll handle the rest on my own, somehow. 
 Subaru Natsuki |" But... I'd appreciate it if you
could deliver a message. "
 Reinhard van Astrea | I'd be glad to, of course. 
 Reinhard van Astrea | To whom? And what? 
 Subaru Natsuki | Well, I don't know her name, but... 
 Subaru Natsuki |" Have you seen a girl with white
robes and silver hair nearby? "
 Reinhard van Astrea | White robes and silver hair? 
 Subaru Natsuki | She's also extremely gorgeous! 
 Reinhard van Astrea | No, I haven't. 
 Subaru Natsuki | Then, if you do see her, 
 Subaru Natsuki |" tell her not to go near the loot
house, no matter what. "
 Subaru Natsuki |" I'll find what she's looking for
and bring it to her myself. "
 Reinhard van Astrea |" Very well. If I see her,
I shall relay your message. "
 Subaru Natsuki | Thanks. 
 Subaru Natsuki | I'll repay you one day! 
 Reinhard van Astrea | All right. 
 Reinhard van Astrea | Take care. 
 EXTRA | Felt's den? 
 EXTRA | Yeah, just go two streets down that way. 
 Subaru Natsuki | Thanks, I appreciate it, bro. 
 EXTRA | Don't mention it, bro. Live strong. 
 Subaru Natsuki | The question is whether Felt will return there... 
 Subaru Natsuki |" I'd rather catch her before she
goes to the loot house, "
 Subaru Natsuki | and trade her the cell phone for the insignia— 
 Subaru Natsuki | Whoa! 
 Elsa Granhiert | Oh, dear! 
 Elsa Granhiert | I'm sorry. Are you all right? 
 Subaru Natsuki | Yeah, I'm fine. 
 Subaru Natsuki |" I don't look it, but toughness
is one thing I... have... "
 Elsa Granhiert | What's wrong? 
 Elsa Granhiert |" You don't have to be so scared.
I won't do anything to you. "
 Subaru Natsuki | I... I'm not scared... 
 Subaru Natsuki | What gave you that idea? 
 Elsa Granhiert | Your scent. 
 Elsa Granhiert | When people are scared, I can smell their fear. 
 Elsa Granhiert | Right now, you're frightened. 
 Elsa Granhiert | You're also angry, aren't you? 
 Elsa Granhiert | At me. 
 Elsa Granhiert | It's fine. 
 Elsa Granhiert |" I'm a little curious, but this isn't
the time to start a commotion. "
 Subaru Natsuki | That's not a very nice thing to say... 
 Subaru Natsuki |" If you're too scary,
that beauty will go to waste— "
 Elsa Granhiert | Oh, very good. 
 Elsa Granhiert |" Conceal your hostility,
and you'll be even better. "
 Elsa Granhiert | Well, I'll be going now. 
 Elsa Granhiert | Something tells me we'll meet again. 
 Subaru Natsuki | Someone actually lives here? 
 Subaru Natsuki |" Elsa hasn't already been here
and trashed it, has she? "
 Subaru Natsuki | I-It's fine, I'm sure... 
 Subaru Natsuki | I don't smell blood. 
 Subaru Natsuki | But it does smell like garbage. 
 Felt |" What do you think you're doing,
peeking into someone's house? "
 Felt | Sorry, but there's nothing worth stealing in there. 
 Felt | Beat it! 
 Subaru Natsuki | No, wait! That's not what I was doing... 
 Felt | Shut up! Don't argue! 
 Subaru Natsuki | Whoa, stop... 
 Subaru Natsuki | Calm down! This is no time to fight! 
 Subaru Natsuki | Before it gets dark— 
 Felt | Before it gets dark, you'd better be gone. 
 Subaru Natsuki | I told you, you've got it all wrong... 
 Felt | You don't give up, do you? 
 Felt | I told you to get out of here! 
 Subaru Natsuki | Just listen to me! 
 Subaru Natsuki | P-Please! Just hear me out, Felt! 
 Subaru Natsuki | I came to see you on important business! 
 Felt | How do you know my name? 
 Felt | You want me to steal something for you? 
 Felt | You should have said that first! 
 Subaru Natsuki | You're the one who attacked me right away. 
 Subaru Natsuki | You know, this is a greedy business you're running! 
 Subaru Natsuki | Do you pride yourself on sticky fingers? 
 Felt | It's all a matter of how to stay alive. 
 Felt |" If it weren't this, I'd have no
choice but to sell my body. "
 Felt | So, what's your business with me? 
 Felt | Spit it out. 
 Subaru Natsuki | There's one thing I want. 
 Subaru Natsuki | Here and now, I want to buy the insignia you stole! 
 Felt | You aren't associated with my client. 
 Felt | Are you a business rival? 
 Subaru Natsuki |" Call her a rival, or call her the
one who killed my parents... "
 Subaru Natsuki | Or even the one who killed me! 
 Felt | You make no sense. 
 Felt |" Well, I'm only interested in selling
to whoever pays most. "
 Felt |" If you've got an offer that might
be profitable, I'll listen. "
 Subaru Natsuki | Very shrewd... 
 Subaru Natsuki |" I have something worth more
than twenty holy coins. "
 Subaru Natsuki | I want to buy your insignia with it. 
 Subaru Natsuki | It's what everyone wants these days, a metia. 
 Subaru Natsuki | That is the power of a metia! 
 Subaru Natsuki |" It's a one-of-a-kind item that can capture
and stop a moment in time. "
 Subaru Natsuki | So, how about it? 
 Felt | You don't seem to be lying. 
 Felt |" But that's supposed to be me?
I'm way prettier. "
 Subaru Natsuki |" If you look this good without makeup,
you're doing fine... "
 Subaru Natsuki | Don't complain. 
 Felt | Well, it is unusual. I'll give you that. 
 Felt | But twenty holy coins? Not likely. 
 Felt | I'm not so stupid as to believe, without question, 
 Felt | everything a prospective buyer says. 
 Subaru Natsuki | Well, of course not. 
 Felt | At the far edge of the slums is a loot house. 
 Felt |" The fair thing is to have the codger who
lives there, Old Man Rom, appraise it. "
 Subaru Natsuki | So it still comes to that... 
 Subaru Natsuki | Okay, got it. Let's go. 
 Subaru Natsuki | Right now... Let's move. 
 Subaru Natsuki | On the double! 
 Subaru Natsuki |" We'll have him take a look,
and get right out of there! "
 Felt | Hey, hey! 
 Felt | What's your problem? 
 Felt | Why are you in such a hurry? 
 Felt | You're soaked with sweat. 
 Felt | Live strong. 
 Subaru Natsuki | Everyone in the slums says that. 
 Subaru Natsuki | Is it some kind of slogan? 
 Felt | Don't lump me in with those guys! 
 Felt | They're all talk. They aren't strong at all. 
 Felt |" They're just a bunch of
stingy losers at life. "
 Subaru Natsuki | That's a bit harsh... 
 Felt | I'm not like the people here. 
 Felt |" I have no intention of living out
my life in these back alleys! "
 Subaru Natsuki |" And you think twenty holy coins will
make your dream come true? "
 Felt |" It's true that it'd be a
huge leap toward my goal. "
 Felt |" Even if I were alone, it isn't as
if I couldn't get by with effort. "
 Subaru Natsuki | If you were alone? 
 Felt | Never mind... 
 Felt | What are you smirking about? 
 Felt | You really piss me off! 
 Subaru Natsuki | Don't worry about it. 
 Felt | H-Hey, what're you doing? Stop! 
 Felt | Hey! 
 Subaru Natsuki | Just gotta make it work, huh? 
 Felt |" I said, ""Stop!"" "
 Subaru Natsuki | And only I can do that. 
 Felt | Don't get all sentimental and babble nonsense! 
 Felt | I'll bite you! 
 Subaru Natsuki | It isn't only for her. 
 Subaru Natsuki | I'll change the fate that's waiting for me. 
 Subaru Natsuki | And to do that, I'll... 
 Felt | I told you to cut it out! 
 Rom | So this is a metia... 
 Rom | Even I've never seen one before. 
 Subaru Natsuki | It's fairly delicate, so handle it with care. 
 Subaru Natsuki |" Think along the lines of, ""If you
break it, you have to die,"" "
 Subaru Natsuki | like no do-overs. 
 Rom | Yeah, I'm definitely impressed. 
 Rom | If I were to sell this, I'd take no less than fifteen... no, twenty holy coins. 
 Rom | It's worth at least that. 
 Subaru Natsuki | All right! Negotiations complete! 
 Subaru Natsuki |" Now, if we're done talking, let's go for
drinks to celebrate a completed sale! "
 Felt | Hold it! 
 Felt | Why are you in such a hurry? 
 Subaru Natsuki | Life doesn't last forever. 
 Subaru Natsuki | Make every second count. Don't waste any— 
 Felt | Yeah, yeah! 
 Felt | I don't care about all that. 
 Felt | Why do you even want the insignia, anyway? 
 Felt | This insignia is worth a lot more than it looks. 
 Felt | That's why everyone wants it. 
 Felt |" In other words, this would sell
for more than a metia— "
 Subaru Natsuki | Hang on, Felt! That's a dangerous way to think! 
 Subaru Natsuki | He appraised it at over twenty holy coins. 
 Subaru Natsuki | Just sell it for that! Don't ask for more! 
 Subaru Natsuki |" El— The woman who asked you for it
can't go higher than twenty, either. "
 Subaru Natsuki | She won't pay more than that! 
 Felt | How do you know that? 
 Felt | You just admitted that you're with them. 
 Subaru Natsuki | I don't have time... Please, Felt! 
 Felt | Begging won't help. 
 Felt | I acknowledge you as a negotiating party. 
 Felt |" But not hearing what my client
says wouldn't be fair. "
 Subaru Natsuki | The reason I want that insignia 
 Subaru Natsuki | is so I can return it to its owner. 
 Felt | Huh? 
 Subaru Natsuki | I want to return it to its owner! 
 Subaru Natsuki | That's why I want the insignia! 
 Subaru Natsuki | That's all! So please! 
 Rom | Felt, it doesn't look to me like the boy's lying. 
 Felt | Don't get taken in by him. 
 Felt | He's obviously joking around. 
 Felt | Return it to the owner? Ridiculous! 
 Felt | If you're gonna lie, make it believable! 
 Felt | I won't be fooled! 
 Subaru Natsuki | Felt... 
 Rom | Who's that? 
 Felt | It might be for me. 
 Felt | It's a little early, though. 
 Subaru Natsuki | Don't open it! 
 Subaru Natsuki | W-We'll be killed! 
 Emilia | Kill you? I wouldn't do something so terrifying. 
 EXTRA | Reunion with the Witch 
 Emilia | I'm glad you're here. 
 Emilia | This time, you won't get away. 
 Subaru Natsuki | Why is she here? It's still light out. 
 Subaru Natsuki |" Wait, if she hadn't been with me,
would she have arrived this early? "
 Felt | You never quit, do you? 
 Felt | I'm telling you, just give up already! 
 Emilia | Sorry, but this is something I cannot give up on. 
 Emilia | If you do as I say, I won't hurt you. 
 Emilia | I have only one demand. Return my insignia. 
 Emilia | It's very important to me. 
 Rom |" If she were just another magic
user, I wouldn't back down, "
 Rom | but this one's trouble... 
 Felt | What's with you, Old Man Rom? 
 Felt | Admitting defeat before we even fight?! 
 Rom | Young lady, you're an elf, ain't ya? 
 Emilia | Not exactly. 
 Emilia | I'm only a half-elf. 
 Felt | A half-elf? 
 Felt | And with silver hair... Wait, are you... 
 Emilia |" It's an accidental resemblance!
Really, it's bothersome to me. "
 Felt | You set me up, didn't you? 
 Subaru Natsuki | Huh? No, I didn't do anything... 
 Felt |" After you said you'd return it to its owner,
I thought you were suspicious! "
 Emilia | What do you mean? You two aren't working together? 
 Subaru Natsuki |" Her nature never changes, no matter how
many times I start over in this world. "
 Felt | Hey! What are you laughing about?! 
 Subaru Natsuki | Come on, isn't that enough? Return her insignia. 
 Subaru Natsuki | And, Sat— you, hurry and get out of here. 
 Subaru Natsuki | Try not to let anyone steal it again. 
 Emilia | Why are you suddenly being so nice? 
 Emilia | I don't understand at all. 
 Felt | I don't understand you, either! 
 Felt | What's up with you? 
 Subaru Natsuki | Puck! Shield her! 
 Puck | That was a bit closer than I expected. 
 Puck | You saved us! 
 Subaru Natsuki | Nice one, Puck! 
 Subaru Natsuki |" Thank goodness it was before five,
while you're still on duty. "
 Subaru Natsuki | Thanks! 
 Elsa Granhiert | A spirit... That is a spirit, yes? 
 Elsa Granhiert | How wonderful. 
 Elsa Granhiert | I have never dissected a spirit's stomach before. 
 Felt | Hey, what do you mean by that? 
 Elsa Granhiert |" We can hardly negotiate, if the
item's original owner is here. "
 Elsa Granhiert | So I have changed my plans. 
 Elsa Granhiert | I shall slaughter everyone here. 
 Elsa Granhiert | You failed to see your job through to the end. 
 Elsa Granhiert | You talk a good game, but you do terrible work. 
 Elsa Granhiert | You really are just another slum dweller. 
 Subaru Natsuki | You bitch... 
 Subaru Natsuki | Cut the crap! 
 Subaru Natsuki | Don't get your kicks from picking on a little kid! 
 Subaru Natsuki | You guts-loving sadist! 
 Subaru Natsuki | Felt is doing her best to live strong... 
 Subaru Natsuki |" Just because your plan was thrown off,
you think it's over and flip tables? "
 Subaru Natsuki | Are you a little kid?! 
 Subaru Natsuki | You should value life more! 
 Subaru Natsuki |" Do you know how much having
your belly cut open hurts? "
 Subaru Natsuki | Well, I do! 
 Elsa Granhiert | What are you talking about? 
 Subaru Natsuki |" I'm in the process of letting the justice
and chivalry I never knew I had "
 Subaru Natsuki | denounce all the world's unfairness! 
 Subaru Natsuki |" And what I consider ""unfair"" is you,
this situation, and... "
 Subaru Natsuki | Stay tuned, folks. 
 Subaru Natsuki | There! 
 Subaru Natsuki | All done buying time... 
 Subaru Natsuki | Get her, Puck! 
 Puck |" A brilliant display of awkwardness, which I
hope survives through the ages. "
 Puck | I'd better live up to your expectations! 
 Puck | We haven't introduced ourselves, have we? 
 Puck | My name's Puck. 
 Puck | Remember my name 
 Puck | after you die! 
 Rom | Did they get 'er?! 
 Subaru Natsuki | Don't trigger that flag, old man! 
 Elsa Granhiert | One should always be prepared. 
 Emilia | Don't underestimate a user of the spiritual arts. 
 Puck | For a girl, you're well accustomed to battle. 
 Elsa Granhiert |" My, it's been a while since I was
regarded as a simple girl. "
 Puck |" Well, from my perspective, all opponents
are basically babies. "
 Puck | Still, you're so strong, I almost pity you. 
 Elsa Granhiert | I'm deeply touched to be praised by a spirit. 
 Subaru Natsuki |" If this turns into a battle of attrition,
we should have a chance. "
 Rom |" No, fer a spirit, the real battle is how
long they can stay corporeal. "
 Subaru Natsuki | That's right, it must be almost five... 
 Elsa Granhiert |" Oh, and just when we were having
such fun. What a bore. "
 Puck | That's what sucks about being a ladies' man. 
 Puck | The girls just won't let you sleep. 
 Puck |" But you know, staying up late is bad for
your skin, so we should wrap this up! "
 Puck | I wasn't just randomly throwing those around. 
 Elsa Granhiert | Does this mean I've been had? 
 Puck | Goodnight! 
 Elsa Granhiert | My, how lovely... 
 Elsa Granhiert | I thought I was going to die. 
 Puck |" But you're a girl, so I don't find that
sort of thing very impressive. "
 Emilia | Puck, can you keep going? 
 Puck | Sorry, I'm really sleepy... 
 Puck | I underestimated her a bit... 
 Puck | My mana's gone, so I have to disappear. 
 Emilia |" I'll take care of things here,
so you can rest. Thank you. "
 Puck |" If anything happens to you, I'll act
according to my contract. "
 Puck |" If it comes to it, call me, even if you
have to squeeze me out of my odo. "
 Elsa Granhiert | You're going away? 
 Elsa Granhiert | Well, that is very unfortunate. 
 Rom | We can't keep just sitting around, watchin', Felt. 
 Felt | Yeah, I know. 
 Felt | If we're going to run, we should get moving now. 
 Felt | About before, well... 
 Felt | I guess you kinda saved me. 
 Felt | But just a little. 
 Felt | Also, don't call me a little kid! 
 Felt | I'm fifteen, you know! 
 Felt | That can't be much younger than you! 
 Subaru Natsuki | I'll be eighteen this year... 
 Felt | No way! You're totally a kid! 
 Felt |" You need to live a life that
shows on your face more! "
 Rom | Here I come! 
 Elsa Granhiert | Ah, but isn't it a bit boorish to cut in on a dance? 
 Rom |" If you wanna dance, I'll show you the
best dancin' you've ever seen! "
 Rom | Here we go... Round an' round! 
 Rom | Eh? What in the— 
 Elsa Granhiert | You're so strong, I was able to do this. 
 Felt | Not gonna happen! 
 Felt | Old Man Rom! 
 Elsa Granhiert | You bad girl... 
 Elsa Granhiert | You have neither the resolve nor strength to fight. 
 Elsa Granhiert |" You should have at least stayed in the
corner, making yourself small... "
 Subaru Natsuki |" Damn, we're done for...
There's really nothing I can do. "
 Subaru Natsuki | I guess I'll have to Return by Death and start over. 
 Subaru Natsuki | No, I don't want to feel that pain again. 
 Subaru Natsuki | I don't wanna die... 
 Subaru Natsuki | I guess, as long as I have life, 
 Subaru Natsuki | all I can do is fight with all my might. 
 Subaru Natsuki | Haidara! 
 Subaru Natsuki | Are you okay? 
 Felt | Why did you... 
 Subaru Natsuki | Listen to me, Felt. I'm going to buy us time. 
 Subaru Natsuki |" I'll give you an opening somehow.
So when I do, run as fast as you can! "
 Felt |" What? You're telling me to tuck my
tail between my legs and run?! "
 Subaru Natsuki |" Yes... Stick out your butt,
tuck in your tail, and run. "
 Subaru Natsuki | You're fifteen, and I'm eighteen. 
 Subaru Natsuki |" That means you're probably
the youngest one here. "
 Subaru Natsuki |" So it's a given we'd pick the method
most likely to keep you alive. "
 Subaru Natsuki | It's a given! 
 Felt |" Give me a break. A minute ago,
you were cowering in fear! "
 Subaru Natsuki | That was then. This is now. 
 Subaru Natsuki | I'm not cowering now, so it's fine. 
 Subaru Natsuki | Take this! 
 Subaru Natsuki | Now! Go, Felt! 
 Elsa Granhiert | You think I'll let her go? 
 Subaru Natsuki | Whoa, I'm awesome! 
 Subaru Natsuki |" But that hurt the tips of my toes
more than I expected. "
 Subaru Natsuki | You let one get away... 
 Elsa Granhiert | For once, I did feel a tiny bit annoyed. 
 Emilia | Don't forget about me. 
 Elsa Granhiert | I've grown quite tired of that game by now. 
 Elsa Granhiert | Do you think you can still keep me amused? 
 Subaru Natsuki | If you've got some hidden true power, 
 Subaru Natsuki | now would be a good time to use it. 
 Emilia | I do have a trump card. 
 Emilia | But if I use it, I'll be the only one left standing. 
 Subaru Natsuki | No exploding yourself, please... 
 Subaru Natsuki | Don't do anything hasty, okay? 
 Emilia | I won't use it. 
 Emilia | Not when you're still here, 
 Emilia | doing your best. 
 Subaru Natsuki | Just now, I didn't see anything... 
 Emilia | Huh? 
 Subaru Natsuki | None of that whole conversation ever happened! 
 Subaru Natsuki | I finally remembered why I'm here, to begin with. 
 Subaru Natsuki | I'll kill you, you shitbag! 
 Subaru Natsuki | I won't let you play your trump card! 
 Subaru Natsuki | I'll blow you away and get 
 Subaru Natsuki | a happy ending! 
 Elsa Granhiert | It looks like you have a bit too much energy. 
 Subaru Natsuki | You black widow! 
 Elsa Granhiert |" Well, there's no doubt you'll be
the first caught in my web. "
 Subaru Natsuki | Nice cover! 
 Subaru Natsuki | Ouch, damn it! How do you like this?! 
 Elsa Granhiert | I caught you. 
 Reinhard van Astrea | That's enough. 
 Reinhard van Astrea | It looks like that was a close call, 
 Reinhard van Astrea | but I'm glad I made it in time. 
 Reinhard van Astrea | Now... 
 Elsa Granhiert | You're... 
 Reinhard van Astrea | Shall we put an end to this? 
 Felt | Someone! 
 Felt | Anyone! Is anyone here?! 
 Felt | Damn it! Please... Please, someone... 
 Felt | Someone help! 
 Reinhard van Astrea | Very well. 
 Reinhard van Astrea | I'll help. 
 Subaru Natsuki | Reinhard? 
 Reinhard van Astrea | That's right, Subaru. 
 Reinhard van Astrea | We meet again. Sorry I'm late. 
 Reinhard van Astrea | Black hair, black clothes, 
 Reinhard van Astrea | and a blade unique to the northern provinces. 
 Reinhard van Astrea | There is no mistaking those characteristics. 
 Reinhard van Astrea | You are the Bowel Hunter. 
 Subaru Natsuki | What kind of evil nickname is that? 
 Reinhard van Astrea | It was derived from her unique killing style. 
 Reinhard van Astrea |" Her name is known, even in the capital,
as that of a dangerous individual. "
 Elsa Granhiert | Reinhard... Yes, a knight among knights, 
 Elsa Granhiert | born to a line of master swordsmen, correct? 
 Elsa Granhiert |" How remarkable, having all my
opponents be so much fun. "
 Reinhard van Astrea | There are many things I'd like to ask you. 
 Reinhard van Astrea | I strongly suggest you surrender. 
 Elsa Granhiert |" You expect a starving predator to
resist such choice, juicy prey? "
 Reinhard van Astrea | Subaru, stand back a bit. 
 Reinhard van Astrea | If you could stand next to her, I'd appreciate it. 
 Subaru Natsuki | You got it. 
 Subaru Natsuki |" That woman is like a monster,
so don't lower your guard... "
 Reinhard van Astrea | As luck would have it, 
 Reinhard van Astrea | hunting monsters happens to be my specialty. 
 Subaru Natsuki | Old Man Rom is still alive? 
 Emilia |" He isn't out of the woods yet.
I have to heal him now. "
 Subaru Natsuki |" You really want to? He's part of the
gang that stole your insignia. "
 Emilia | That's why. 
 Emilia |" I need him to recover, so he'll repay
the favor by giving me information. "
 Emilia | He wouldn't lie to the one who saved his life. 
 Emilia | This is as much for my own sake. 
 Reinhard van Astrea | I would rather not use violence on a woman. 
 Elsa Granhiert | Just as the rumors say... No, 
 Elsa Granhiert | you are even better. 
 Reinhard van Astrea | I'm not sure I'll meet your expectations. 
 Elsa Granhiert | Aren't you going to use that sword at your hip? 
 Elsa Granhiert | I would love to experience its legendary sharpness. 
 Reinhard van Astrea | This sword can only be drawn when needed. 
 Reinhard van Astrea | The fact that it hasn't left its sheath 
 Reinhard van Astrea | means this is not one of those times. 
 Elsa Granhiert | I do believe I've been underestimated. 
 Reinhard van Astrea | Well, it's an upsetting judgment for me, as well. 
 Reinhard van Astrea | Therefore, 
 Reinhard van Astrea | I shall take you on with this instead. 
 Reinhard van Astrea | Do you object? 
 Elsa Granhiert | No, it is wonderful. Wonderful! 
 Elsa Granhiert | Do entertain me, please. 
 Reinhard van Astrea |" If you've lost your weapon,
I strongly suggest you surrender. "
 Subaru Natsuki | She's got a second one, Reinhard! 
 Elsa Granhiert | I'm impressed you knew. 
 Subaru Natsuki | Well, I've personally experienced it... 
 Elsa Granhiert | But I don't have merely two fangs. 
 Elsa Granhiert | Would you mind if we start again? 
 Reinhard van Astrea |" If I divest you of all your weapons,
will you be satisfied? "
 Elsa Granhiert | If I lose my fangs, I'll use my claws. 
 Elsa Granhiert | If I lose my claws, I'll use my bones. 
 Elsa Granhiert | And if I lose my bones, I'll use my life. 
 Elsa Granhiert |" That is how a ""Bowel Hunter"" fights. "
 Subaru Natsuki |" Surely Reinhard won't fail to land
the decisive blow, will he? "
 Emilia |" Because I'm using my spiritual arts,
he cannot fight at full strength. "
 Subaru Natsuki | What do those have to do with each other? 
 Emilia | If Reinhard were truly intent on fighting, 
 Emilia |" all the mana in the atmosphere
would turn away from me. "
 Emilia | I'm almost done healing him. 
 Emilia | When I give the signal, let him know. 
 Emilia | Now he's all right. Go ahead. 
 Subaru Natsuki | Reinhard! I don't really get it, but do your thing! 
 Elsa Granhiert | What will you show me? 
 Reinhard van Astrea | The swordplay of the Astrea family. 
 Elsa Granhiert | The Bowel Hunter, Elsa Granhiert. 
 Reinhard van Astrea |" Reinhard van Astrea, of the
line of master swordsmen. "
 Subaru Natsuki | Whoa, whoa, whoa! 
 Subaru Natsuki | Hunting monsters is your specialty, my ass! 
 Subaru Natsuki | You're a monster yourself! 
 Reinhard van Astrea |" Even I'm a bit hurt by a comment
like that, Subaru. "
 Reinhard van Astrea | I'm sorry I asked too much of you. 
 Reinhard van Astrea | Rest well now. 
 Subaru Natsuki | There isn't a shadow left, let alone a body... 
 Subaru Natsuki | This is all that's left after just a sword swing? 
 Emilia | It's over now? 
 Subaru Natsuki | Yeah, somehow or other. Literally. 
 Emilia | Why are you staring at me? That's quite rude. 
 Subaru Natsuki |" It's just, you still have your arms
and legs, even your head... "
 Emilia | Of course I do. Don't say such scary things. 
 Subaru Natsuki | Yeah, you're right. It's obvious, huh? 
 Subaru Natsuki | I still have my arms, too. 
 Subaru Natsuki |" And there's no knife in my back
or gaping hole in my gut. "
 Emilia |" You talk as if you've experienced
those things before. "
 Subaru Natsuki | There was a time when I did. 
 Subaru Natsuki | Oh, yeah, Reinhard... I haven't thanked you yet. 
 Subaru Natsuki | You saved my ass! 
 Subaru Natsuki | Back in the alley, too. 
 Subaru Natsuki | I guess you heard my heart's cries for help, friend! 
 Reinhard van Astrea | If I did do that, I'd certainly be proud... 
 Reinhard van Astrea | Friend. 
 Reinhard van Astrea | She was desperately running around the streets, 
 Reinhard van Astrea | and she asked for my help. 
 Emilia | That's... 
 Subaru Natsuki | Now, hang on... 
 Subaru Natsuki |" If she hadn't brought Reinhard,
we'd have been destroyed. "
 Subaru Natsuki |" Just take a look at this face, and spare
me the ice-statue punishment, okay? "
 Emilia | I wouldn't do anything so violent! 
 Emilia | And what does your face have to do with— 
 Reinhard van Astrea | Subaru! 
 Subaru Natsuki | She'll go for the gut! 
 Elsa Granhiert | He got in my way again. 
 Reinhard van Astrea | That's enough, Elsa! 
 Elsa Granhiert | Soon enough, I'll disembowel everyone here. 
 Elsa Granhiert | Till then, take good care of your bowels. 
 Reinhard van Astrea | Are you all right? 
 Emilia |" Whether I'm all right doesn't
matter! More importantly, "
 Emilia | are you all right? That was far too reckless! 
 Subaru Natsuki | Ow... 
 Subaru Natsuki | Oh, it was no problem. 
 Subaru Natsuki |" I sure took the long road, but I
finally reached this point. "
 Subaru Natsuki | My name is Natsuki Subaru! 
 Subaru Natsuki | And I just saved your life from a heinous villain! 
 Subaru Natsuki | Are we OK on that? 
 Emilia |" ""OK""? "
 Subaru Natsuki |" It means ""Are we clear on that?"" So... "
 Subaru Natsuki | OK? 
 Emilia | O-OK... 
 Subaru Natsuki | I, your rescuer, saved your life. 
 Subaru Natsuki | And you are the heroine I saved! 
 Subaru Natsuki |" So wouldn't that mean you should
repay me in kind? Wouldn't it? "
 Emilia | All right, I get it. 
 Emilia | Only if it's within my power, of course. 
 Subaru Natsuki | In that case, I have only one request! 
 Subaru Natsuki | Yes, my request is... 
 Subaru Natsuki | Tell me your name. 
 Emilia | Emilia. 
 Subaru Natsuki | Huh? 
 Emilia | My name is Emilia. Just Emilia. 
 Emilia | Thank you, Subaru. For saving me. 
 Subaru Natsuki | All those times I got hurt, all the crying I did, 
 Subaru Natsuki |" all the pain I felt, all the fighting
I did with my life at stake... "
 Subaru Natsuki | And my reward was her name and a single smile. 
 Subaru Natsuki | Jeez... 
 Subaru Natsuki | Talk about unequal compensation. 
 Reinhard van Astrea | Anyway, Subaru, I'm impressed that you're unhurt. 
 Subaru Natsuki | That thing protected me just in time. 
 Subaru Natsuki | If not for that, I'd be in two pieces right now. 
 Reinhard van Astrea | True, if not for this... 
 Reinhard van Astrea | Eh? 
 Subaru Natsuki | Uh-oh. I should have seen this coming. 
 Emilia | Subaru? 
 Emilia | Subaru! 
 Subaru Natsuki | Man... 
 Subaru Natsuki | She's so cute when she's panicking... 
 Subaru Natsuki | A parallel world fantasy... 
 Emilia | There. His treatment is complete. 
 Emilia | He should be over the hump now. 
 Reinhard van Astrea |" By the way, Lady Emilia, what is
your relation to Subaru? "
 Emilia | A passing acquaintance? 
 Emilia | I don't recall ever meeting him before. 
 Emilia | I thought our meeting, earlier today, was the first. 
 Reinhard van Astrea | But he was looking for you. 
 Reinhard van Astrea | He said he had something to give you. 
 Emilia | That's why it's so strange... 
 Reinhard van Astrea | What shall we do with him? 
 Reinhard van Astrea | I would be glad to take him home as a guest. 
 Emilia | No, I'll take him home with me. 
 Emilia | That way, I can learn what's really going on. 
 Emilia |" But more importantly, what will become
of that girl and the old man? "
 Reinhard van Astrea | Officially, I cannot overlook what they've done. 
 Reinhard van Astrea | But... 
 Reinhard van Astrea | Unfortunately, I'm off duty today. 
 Emilia | You're a bad knight. 
 Emilia | Is this old man your family? 
 Felt |" Something like that.
Old Man Rom is the only one I have... "
 Felt | I guess he's like my grandpa. 
 Emilia | I see. I only have one family member, too. 
 Emilia |" But he's always asleep at the
most important moments. "
 Emilia | When he's awake, I'd never say that aloud. 
 Felt | I thought you'd be a lot harsher to me. 
 Felt | I'm sorry. 
 Felt | You saved my life, and I can't let a debt go unpaid. 
 Felt | I'll return what I stole. 
 Felt |" If it's important, keep it hidden,
so no one can steal it again! "
 Emilia | It feels funny, having you give me that warning. 
 Emilia | Reinhard? 
 Felt | You're hurting me! Let go! 
 Reinhard van Astrea | How can this be? 
 Reinhard van Astrea | What is your name? 
 Felt | Huh? It's Felt... 
 Reinhard van Astrea | And your family name? How old are you? 
 Felt | I don't have anything fancy like a family name! 
 Felt | I'm... about fifteen, I think. 
 Felt | I don't know my birthday. 
 Felt | Look, just let me go! 
 Reinhard van Astrea |" Lady Emilia, I am afraid I cannot
keep my promise to you. "
 Reinhard van Astrea | I shall be taking this girl with me. 
 Felt | May I ask why? If it's for stealing my insignia... 
 Reinhard van Astrea | That is, indeed, no small crime. 
 Reinhard van Astrea |" But compared to the gravity of overlooking
the crime unfolding before me, it's trivial. "
 Reinhard van Astrea | I need you to come with me. 
 Reinhard van Astrea | I'm sorry, but I cannot allow you to refuse. 
 Felt | Get over yourself! Just because you saved me— 
 Emilia | That wasn't very courtly, either. 
 Reinhard van Astrea | I was careful not to use too much. 
 Reinhard van Astrea |" Lady Emilia, I will be calling
upon you soon, most likely. "
 Reinhard van Astrea | I hope you understand. 
 Reinhard van Astrea | Please take good care of Subaru. 
 Reinhard van Astrea |" Today may be the last chance we
have to gaze calmly at the moon. "
 EXTRA | Starting Life from Zero in World 
 Subaru Natsuki | I don't know this ceiling. 
 Subaru Natsuki | The wound on my stomach is gone... 
 Subaru Natsuki | Everything considered, it must've been her. 
 Subaru Natsuki | Emilia's healing power, huh? 
 Subaru Natsuki |" Well, at any rate, seems I got out of
using Return by Death this time... "
 Subaru Natsuki | But normally, wouldn't you wake up to a girl 
 Subaru Natsuki |" by your bed asking, ""Are you awake,""
after she'd cared for you all this time? "
 Subaru Natsuki |" For a story about being summoned to
another world, it's kinda flawed. "
 Subaru Natsuki | A looping hallway... 
 Subaru Natsuki |" One of those things where I can't
leave until I find the right room? "
 Subaru Natsuki |" The typical pattern says that the
first door is likely to be it! "
 Beatrice |" What a profoundly aggravating
man you are, I suppose. "
 Subaru Natsuki | First NPC found! 
 Subaru Natsuki |" With that cold attitude, you're gonna
ruin your cute face. "
 Subaru Natsuki | Come on, smile... Smile. 
 Beatrice | A derisive sneer is the only smile worth giving you. 
 Subaru Natsuki |" Are you mad because I guessed
correctly on the first try? "
 Subaru Natsuki | I've always been a pretty lucky guesser... 
 Subaru Natsuki |" I can understand why game masters would
want me in all the events, but sorry! "
 Subaru Natsuki | So, what is this place, anyway? 
 Beatrice |" Hmph, it's Betty's multi-purpose room,
both library and bedroom, I suppose. "
 Subaru Natsuki | Talk about your token response. 
 Subaru Natsuki | Are you one of the manual girls everyone's into now? 
 Beatrice | Betty's had just about enough. 
 Beatrice | Time to teach you a lesson, I suppose. 
 Subaru Natsuki | Hey, what are you gonna do? 
 Beatrice | Don't you dare move. 
 Beatrice | Anything you'd like to say? 
 Subaru Natsuki | D-Don't hurt me. 
 Subaru Natsuki | What did you do to me, you drill loli? 
 Beatrice | I only collected the mana from your body, I suppose. 
 Beatrice | It confirmed that you are not an enemy. 
 Subaru Natsuki | You're not human, are you? 
 Subaru Natsuki | And I don't mean your personality... 
 Beatrice | It took you long enough to notice, I suppose. 
 Subaru Natsuki | I take it back... Your personality isn't human, either. 
 Beatrice |" Do not measure a proud, noble being
by your standards, human. "
 Subaru Natsuki | I know that ceiling. 
 Rem | Oh, he has awakened, Sister. 
 Ram | Indeed, he has awakened, Rem. 
 Subaru Natsuki | I, a denizen of the night, waking in the morning? 
 Subaru Natsuki | I'm getting all emotional... 
 Subaru Natsuki | I'd better go to sleep a second time. 
 Subaru Natsuki | No, I woke up earlier, so this'll be the third. 
 Rem | My, what a deadbeat thing to say. 
 Rem | Did you hear that, Sister? 
 Ram | Yes, truly a loser's words. I heard him, Rem. 
 Subaru Natsuki | All right! 
 Subaru Natsuki |" Who are these two voices that
keep criticizing me in stereo?! "
 Subaru Natsuki | N-No way... 
 Subaru Natsuki | Maid costumes exist in this world, too? 
 Subaru Natsuki |" In my mind, maids were always the
very personification of elegance! "
 Subaru Natsuki | This ain't so bad, either! 
 Rem |" How terrible. You are being violated
in our guest's mind, Sister. "
 Ram |" It is terrible. You are experiencing the ultimate
shame in our guest's mind, Rem. "
 Subaru Natsuki | Don't underestimate my capacity. 
 Subaru Natsuki | You're both fair prey in my fantasies... 
 Emilia | Can't you wake up more peacefully, Subaru? 
 Subaru Natsuki | Whoever picked that outfit totally gets it! 
 Emilia | I don't know what you're talking about, 
 Emilia |" but the fact that I know it's something
stupid is disappointing. "
 Rem | Listen to this, Miss Emilia. 
 Rem | My dear sister was just violated by that man. 
 Ram | Please listen to this, Miss Emilia. 
 Ram | Rem was held prisoner and shamed by that man. 
 Emilia | And you two, don't tease him too much. 
 Rem | Yes, Miss Emilia. My sister is very sorry. 
 Ram | Yes, Miss Emilia. Rem is sorry, as well. 
 Emilia | Subaru, are you feeling all right? 
 Emilia | Does anything feel off? 
 Subaru Natsuki | Huh? Oh, I'm just a little groggy from oversleeping. 
 Subaru Natsuki | You saved me, didn't you, Emilia-tan? 
 Emilia |" Huh? ""Tan""? "
 Emilia |" What does ""tan"" mean? "
 Subaru Natsuki | Uh, you can just ignore that one. 
 Subaru Natsuki | Seriously, though, thanks. You saved me. 
 Emilia | No, I'm the one who should thank you. 
 Emilia |" You barely know me, but you
risked your life to save me. "
 Emilia | It's natural I would heal your wounds afterward. 
 Subaru Natsuki | Then, once again, 
 Subaru Natsuki | I guess it's time to start a new day! 
 Subaru Natsuki | This place really is huge... 
 Subaru Natsuki | The yard isn't so much a yard as a field. 
 Emilia |" Those are unusual movements.
What are you doing? "
 Subaru Natsuki |" My homeland's ancient practice
of warm-up exercises. "
 Subaru Natsuki | Come on, Emilia-tan! Join me! 
 Subaru Natsuki | Radio calisthenics, number 2... 
 Subaru Natsuki | Bounce on both feet to loosen up your body! 
 Emilia | Huh? You're kidding! What is that? 
 Subaru Natsuki | Just do what I do. 
 Subaru Natsuki | I'll drill the essence of radio calisthenics into you! 
 Subaru Natsuki |" Now, raise both arms and shout, ""Victory!"" "
 Emilia | V-Victory! 
 Puck | Victory! Victory! 
 Puck | Victory! 
 Puck | Hi, Subaru! Great morning, isn't it? 
 Subaru Natsuki |" Well, since the wee hours of the morning,
it's been nothing but chaos for me. "
 Subaru Natsuki |" Looping hallways and a mean
little girl on a rampage... "
 Subaru Natsuki |" And then, shedding the sweat
of passion with Emilia-tan. "
 Emilia | Don't make it sound so scandalous! 
 Emilia | Good morning, Puck. 
 Emilia | Sorry I put you through so much yesterday. 
 Puck | Morning, Lia. I almost lost you yesterday. 
 Puck | I can never thank Subaru enough. 
 Puck | I must do something for him. 
 Subaru Natsuki | Okay, then... 
 Subaru Natsuki | Let me pet your fur whenever I want! 
 Emilia | Huh? That's all? 
 Subaru Natsuki | For a first-rate fur master such as myself, 
 Subaru Natsuki |" being able to love on the object of
your petting affections anytime "
 Subaru Natsuki | is worth as much as a multimillionaire's riches! 
 Subaru Natsuki | Oh, man, these ears... 
 Subaru Natsuki | I'm in love with how soft you are. 
 Puck |" Since I can kind of read your mind,
I know you feel that way, "
 Puck | but I'm amazed you can say it! 
 Puck | It's okay, Lia. 
 Puck | I can't find any malice, hostility, or ill-intent in Subaru. 
 Subaru Natsuki |" It's so cute how you call her ""Lia,"" too. "
 Puck |" Not as cute as your ""Emilia-tan""! "
 Emilia | You really are strange, Subaru. 
 Subaru Natsuki | Huh? 
 Emilia | Oh? What brings you two here? 
 Rem | Miss Emilia... 
 Ram | Miss Emilia... 
 Ram | Our lord, Master Roswaal, has returned. 
 Rem | Our lord, Master Roswaal, has returned. 
 Rem | Please come inside. 
 Ram | Please come inside. 
 Beatrice |" I was watching you from upstairs,
and you know what? "
 Beatrice | It would seem you are quite dumb, I suppose. 
 Subaru Natsuki | Where do you get off saying that, you loli?! 
 Beatrice | What does that word mean? 
 Beatrice | I have never heard it before, and it irritates me. 
 Puck | Hey, Betty. Haven't seen you in four days. 
 Puck | Have you been doing well and staying ladylike? 
 Beatrice | Bubby! 
 Beatrice | I've been waiting for you to come home. 
 Beatrice | Will you stay with me today, do you suppose? 
 Puck | Sure, no problem. 
 Puck | Let's finally relax together today. 
 Beatrice | Yay! 
 Emilia | Bewildered, aren't you? 
 Emilia | Beatrice is so taken with Puck. 
 Subaru Natsuki |" Who even says ""bewildered"" nowadays? "
 Roswaal L. Mathers | My, my! How unusual to see you here, Beatrice... 
 Roswaal L. Mathers | I'm so happy you've decided to dine with me. 
 Beatrice |" That boy is more than enough of an
addle-brained fool for me, I suppose. "
 Beatrice | Betty was only waiting for Bubby! 
 Subaru Natsuki |" You guys hired a clown to entertain
you before each meal? "
 Subaru Natsuki | I'll never understand how rich folks think. 
 Emilia | Um, Subaru, that man is... 
 Roswaal L. Mathers | Oh, no... It's quite all right, Miss Emilia... 
 Subaru Natsuki | What's going on? 
 Roswaal L. Mathers |" Only that I am the lord of this
manor, Roswaal L. Mathers, "
 Roswaal L. Mathers | Natsuki Subaru-kun. 
 Subaru Natsuki | This is way better than normal food! 
 Roswaal L. Mathers |" Despite her appearance, Rem's cooking
is quite impressive. "
 Subaru Natsuki |" So this was cooked by the one with
blue hair... Um, Rem-chan, right? "
 Subaru Natsuki | You made this? 
 Rem | Yes, sir. 
 Rem | I do the cooking in this house. 
 Rem | My sister is not very good at cooking. 
 Subaru Natsuki | Ah, twins who are good at different things! 
 Subaru Natsuki | Is your sister good at cleaning, then? 
 Rem | Yes, that is correct. 
 Rem |" My sister excels at housework,
particularly cleaning and laundry. "
 Subaru Natsuki |" So, Rem-rin, you're good at cooking,
but bad at cleaning and laundry? "
 Rem | No, I am generally good at all household tasks. 
 Rem |" I am also better at cleaning
and laundry than my sister. "
 Subaru Natsuki | Does your sister even have a purpose? 
 Roswaal L. Mathers | You are truly a strange young man... 
 Roswaal L. Mathers |" You come to the mansion of Margrave Mathers,
in the kingdom of Lugunica, "
 Roswaal L. Mathers | but you claim to understand nothing! 
 Subaru Natsuki | Is something bad happening in this country? 
 Roswaal L. Mathers | Well, it is not in an agreeable state. 
 Roswaal L. Mathers | After all, Lugunica's king is currently not present. 
 Roswaal L. Mathers | No, there's no need to be concerned... 
 Roswaal L. Mathers | Everyone is already quite aware of the reality. 
 Subaru Natsuki | Really? 
 Subaru Natsuki |" I expected a ""Now that you know my secret,
I can't let you leave here alive"" thing. "
 Roswaal L. Mathers |" Around the same time that the king went into hiding,
an epidemic began spreading through the castle! "
 Roswaal L. Mathers | The king and his children are the last of his line. 
 Roswaal L. Mathers | A council of wise men currently manages the nation, 
 Roswaal L. Mathers |" and they are now in the process
of selecting a new king! "
 Subaru Natsuki | I see. I'm starting to get the picture. 
 Subaru Natsuki |" On top of the king's absence, the royal selection
is causing confusion in the kingdom. "
 Subaru Natsuki | Then, suddenly, I appear from another world— 
 Subaru Natsuki | Wait, I'm totally suspect here! 
 Roswaal L. Mathers | And on top of all that, 
 Roswaal L. Mathers |" you made contact with Miss Emilia,
thus becoming connected to my household! "
 Subaru Natsuki |" Wait, why would the lord of the
mansion call her ""Miss Emilia""? "
 Roswaal L. Mathers |" It's only natural to address someone of
higher status with all due respect... "
 Subaru Natsuki | Um, so Emilia-tan would be... 
 Emilia | My current status is 
 Emilia |" a candidate to become the Kingdom
of Lugunica's forty-second ruler, "
 Emilia | with Margrave Roswaal's backing. 
 Subaru Natsuki | What?! 
 Emilia | Sorry to surprise you. 
 Emilia | I wasn't trying to keep it a secret. 
 Subaru Natsuki | Hey, it's that insignia. 
 Emilia | This qualifies one to be a candidate for king. 
 Emilia |" It's a touchstone for determining
if one is worthy of the throne. "
 Subaru Natsuki |" Wait, Emilia-tan, you lost an insignia that
qualifies you to rule the kingdom? "
 Emilia | Don't put it like that! I didn't lose it! 
 Emilia | It was stolen from me by a thief! 
 Subaru Natsuki | That's the same thing! 
 Subaru Natsuki | And what if you lose that thing, anyway? 
 Subaru Natsuki | Will a government office issue you another? 
 Roswaal L. Mathers |" Oh, my! If you'd lost it, then there
would be no doubt... "
 Roswaal L. Mathers |" If it were thought that one who
can't even protect a tiny insignia "
 Roswaal L. Mathers |" can't be entrusted with the nation's
rule, that would be the end. "
 Subaru Natsuki | Now that I think about it, I did a damn good job. 
 Subaru Natsuki | This totally raises my expectations for a reward... 
 Emilia | Yeah, you're right. You were my true savior. 
 Emilia | So ask for anything. 
 Roswaal L. Mathers |" You may have any reward you request.
Merely state your desire! "
 Subaru Natsuki | In that case, I have but one request. 
 Subaru Natsuki | Hire me to work in this mansion! 
 Ram | Achoo. 
 Emilia | That isn't quite right... 
 Emilia | Wasn't there anything else that fit you, Subaru? 
 Subaru Natsuki | Oddly, some of the girls' stuff fit me, but... 
 Rem | Our deepest apologies, sir. I mean, Subaru. 
 Ram | You look quite ridiculous, sir. I mean, Barusu. 
 Subaru Natsuki |" Um, Nee-sama, you just turned my
name into a blinding curse. "
 Ram |" Rem, looking at Barusu's ridiculous
appearance, do you notice anything? "
 Rem |" His shoulders are shaped funny, his legs
are short, and his eyes are scary? "
 Subaru Natsuki | I can't do anything about two of those! 
 Ram |" We cannot allow you to work here
in such shady-looking attire. "
 Ram | People would question Lord Roswaal's dignity. 
 Ram |" Let us alter the jacket, at least.
Rem, if you please. "
 Emilia | All right, I have to study for the royal selection. 
 Emilia | Good luck with your work, too, Subaru. 
 Subaru Natsuki | Yep, leave it to me, Emilia-tan. 
 Rem |" I shall take your measurements. Stand still
and keep your back straight. "
 Rem | Please refrain from strange noises. It's unpleasant. 
 Subaru Natsuki | That was beyond my control... 
 Subaru Natsuki | This is awkward for a guy in multiple ways! 
 Ram | This is the VIP room. 
 Ram | This is the bathing room. 
 Ram | This is the kitchen. 
 Ram | And this is the lavatory. 
 Subaru Natsuki | In a mansion like this, the restroom must be huge. 
 Beatrice | You're so great, Bubby! Your fur is the best— 
 Subaru Natsuki | Don't worry. I won't tell a soul. 
 Subaru Natsuki | The feel of that fur would make anyone— 
 Subaru Natsuki | Hey! Let me finish! 
 Ram | That was Miss Beatrice's Door Crossing. 
 Subaru Natsuki |" So it's a spell that can connect any
door in the mansion to her room? "
 Ram | Once Miss Beatrice has eliminated her presence, 
 Ram |" there is no way to find her without
trying every door in the mansion. "
 Subaru Natsuki | She's in here! 
 Puck | That was impressive, Subaru... 
 Beatrice | You picked the right door again? 
 Subaru Natsuki | What did I tell you? 
 Subaru Natsuki | I'm a flag-crusher who makes game masters cry. 
 Beatrice | I don't understand what you're saying! 
 Subaru Natsuki | I don't know who you are, either. 
 Subaru Natsuki | Ros-chi's little sister? 
 Beatrice | I'd never want to be his sister, I suppose! Hmph! 
 Puck |" Betty is the librarian who oversees the
Roswaal mansion's forbidden library. "
 Ram |" Lord Roswaal is the greatest
magic-user in the kingdom. "
 Ram | He has many books that must not be seen by others. 
 Ram | Miss Beatrice is contracted to protect them. 
 Beatrice | If you get it now, then go away. 
 Ram | This concludes our tour of the mansion. 
 Ram | Any questions? 
 Subaru Natsuki | I know it's no use saying this after it's over, 
 Subaru Natsuki |" but shouldn't Emilia-tan be the one
with me for the tour event? "
 Ram |" If you have no questions, let us
get to your actual job. "
 Ram | You will help me with my work, Barusu. 
 Subaru Natsuki |" This must be where my hidden
skill as a butler reveals itself! "
 Ram |" My work today is caring for the front yard
and garden, helping to prepare lunch, "
 Ram |" polishing the silver, airing the futons,
laundry, bathroom cleaning, "
 Ram | and the mansion's monthly soot cleaning. 
 Subaru Natsuki | I'm exhausted... 
 Rem | This is Rem. Do you have a moment, Subaru? 
 Subaru Natsuki | Sure, I'm good! 
 Subaru Natsuki | I won't do anything weird, so come on in. 
 Rem |" Your permission actually makes
you sound less credible. "
 Rem | Pardon me, then. 
 Subaru Natsuki | You already finished it? 
 Rem |" When it is Lord Roswaal's clothing,
my priority is to take care. "
 Rem | But since this is yours... 
 Subaru Natsuki | Did you just imply that you cut corners? 
 Subaru Natsuki | I hate to admit it, but it's perfect. 
 Subaru Natsuki | Well? Do I look good? 
 Rem | Combined with the rarity of gray clothes, 
 Rem |" no one in any kind of strange
garment could rival you. "
 Subaru Natsuki | Okay! Not a compliment at all! 
 Rem | What shall we do with that? 
 Subaru Natsuki | This one's easy. Got a needle and thread? 
 Rem | I brought them. Shall I repair it now? 
 Subaru Natsuki | Nah, I'll do it. 
 Subaru Natsuki | Don't underestimate my sewing skills... 
 Rem | I am surprised. 
 Rem | I must give you full marks for your sewing. 
 Rem | Like you, however, it does not seem very useful. 
 Subaru Natsuki | Ow! 
 Ram |" You may get full marks for sewing, but you
are still useless with a knife, Barusu. "
 Rem |" As always, you make such a lovely image
when peeling vegetables, Sister. "
 Subaru Natsuki | Your bias is so blatant, it's almost comforting! 
 Subaru Natsuki | I'd like a comment on my work, too! 
 Rem | I pity the farmer who grew those vegetables. 
 Subaru Natsuki | Stop! You're breaking my heart! 
 Ram | You do not know how to handle a knife, Barusu. 
 Ram | You should hold the knife still, turning the vegetable. 
 Ram | Frankly speaking, my best dish is steamed tatoes. 
 Subaru Natsuki | How can you say that with such a triumphant look? 
 Subaru Natsuki | Damn it, just watch. 
 Subaru Natsuki |" My favorite blade, Shooting Star,
will show you a thing or two— "
 Subaru Natsuki | It sliced right through me! 
 Roswaal L. Mathers |" It's been five days since Subaru-kun
came to the mansion. "
 Roswaal L. Mathers | How has he been? 
 Roswaal L. Mathers | By now, we should be seeing something. 
 Ram | Cooking, laundry, cleaning. 
 Ram | He is useless at all of them. 
 Roswaal L. Mathers | How strict of you... 
 Roswaal L. Mathers | And? 
 Roswaal L. Mathers | What of his potential as a spy? 
 Ram |" I cannot deny it exists, but I believe
the possibility is slim. "
 Ram | For better or worse. 
 Ram | Specifically for worse, he is too conspicuous. 
 Roswaal L. Mathers | And if he's too conspicuous... 
 Roswaal L. Mathers | Despite that possibility, he certainly is carefree. 
 Roswaal L. Mathers | As I personally see it, interfering would be wise. 
 Ram | They are only children. 
 Ram | Even if we let them be, nothing will happen. 
 Emilia | It isn't that fun to watch, is it? 
 Subaru Natsuki | When I'm with you, nothing is boring, Emilia-tan. 
 Emilia |" That makes me happy, even if
you're only flattering me. "
 Subaru Natsuki |" Besides, we haven't had a chance
to talk for the past few days. "
 Emilia |" That's right. It must be difficult for
you to learn your work here. "
 Subaru Natsuki | Yes, it is! It's killing me! 
 Subaru Natsuki |" I wish I could be sequentially comforted in
your arms, on your chest, and on your lap— "
 Emilia |" Yeah, yeah. If you can joke around
like that, you must be fine. "
 Subaru Natsuki | The moon sure is pretty. 
 Emilia | Yes, it's far beyond our reach. 
 Subaru Natsuki | I got a really touching response, without even trying! 
 Emilia |" Anyway, don't you think you're
a bit lacking in ambition? "
 Emilia | Like that time with Puck, 
 Emilia | and in the capital, when you asked for my name. 
 Subaru Natsuki | You just don't get it, Emilia-tan... 
 Subaru Natsuki | I want what I want at that exact moment, 
 Subaru Natsuki | and I want it from the bottom of my heart. 
 Emilia | Huh? 
 Subaru Natsuki | At the time, I wanted to know your name. 
 Subaru Natsuki |" In a new land, nervous, and unsure of the future,
I had no expectations for tomorrow. "
 Subaru Natsuki | When I think about it calmly, 
 Subaru Natsuki |" there were probably other things
I should have wanted. "
 Subaru Natsuki | But I can't lie to myself. 
 Subaru Natsuki | Same with the request I made to Ros-chi... 
 Subaru Natsuki | I'm flat broke right now. 
 Subaru Natsuki | I could cheat him out of a fortune and live it up, 
 Subaru Natsuki |" but I can just as easily obtain
a source of livelihood, right? "
 Emilia |" In that case, couldn't you have become a permanent
guest, rather than an employee? "
 Subaru Natsuki | I never thought of that! 
 Subaru Natsuki | Oh, man, talk about pathetic... 
 Subaru Natsuki | You should keep your efforts a secret, huh? 
 Emilia | Do you want me to use my healing magic? 
 Subaru Natsuki | Nah, I'm fine like this. 
 Emilia | Why? 
 Subaru Natsuki | It's kind of hard to explain, but... 
 Subaru Natsuki | Well, this is proof of the effort I put in. 
 Subaru Natsuki | I don't actually dislike exerting myself, you know. 
 Subaru Natsuki | Learning to do something I couldn't do before... 
 Subaru Natsuki | Well, it's not so bad. 
 Emilia | That's right. Yes, I think you're right. 
 Emilia | Really, Subaru, you idiot. 
 Subaru Natsuki | Hey, what's with that reaction? 
 Subaru Natsuki | This is where you fall for me, all over again. 
 Emilia | I never initially fell for you! 
 Emilia | Honestly, you're so silly. 
 Subaru Natsuki | EMA... 
 Emilia | Huh? 
 Subaru Natsuki |" It's short for ""Emilia-tan, major angel."" "
 Emilia | I'm thanking you, and you're joking around again! 
 Emilia | Anyway, I know you're working hard, 
 Emilia | but how did your hands get so torn up? 
 Subaru Natsuki | I cut this one with knives in the kitchen... 
 Subaru Natsuki |" And this is from the evening when
I went shopping in town, "
 Subaru Natsuki |" and a little animal some kids
were playing with bit me. "
 Emilia | It wasn't the result of your effort? 
 Subaru Natsuki | Those kids were ruthless, 
 Subaru Natsuki |" hitting and kicking me, and wiping their
runny noses on me. It sucked, damn it. "
 Emilia |" You do seem like you'd be good
with small children, Subaru. "
 Subaru Natsuki |" I know! Wanna come with me
tomorrow, to get revenge... "
 Subaru Natsuki | I mean, to watch the kids and the small animal? 
 Emilia | It isn't that I don't want to go with you... 
 Subaru Natsuki | Then let's go. 
 Emilia | But if I'm with you, it might cause trouble for you. 
 Subaru Natsuki | Okay, got it! Let's go! 
 Emilia | Are you listening to me? 
 Subaru Natsuki | I am! I hang on every word you say, Emilia-tan! 
 Emilia | Jeez... 
 Emilia |" Only during a break from my studies and
when your work is done, all right? "
 Subaru Natsuki | All right! Roger that! 
 Subaru Natsuki | Hey, loli girl! You're still up? 
 Beatrice |" So now you can break through my Door
Crossing like it's natural, I suppose. "
 Subaru Natsuki | Oh, I just wanted to say hello before going to bed. 
 Subaru Natsuki | Can I try that, too? 
 Beatrice | Only Bubby may touch me, I suppose. 
 Subaru Natsuki | No fair that only you can have fun. 
 Subaru Natsuki | Well, I'm in a good mood, so I can let it go— 
 Beatrice | Enough! Just get out of here! 
 Beatrice | That has nothing to do with Betty, I suppose. 
 Subaru Natsuki | For our date tomorrow, 
 Subaru Natsuki |" I'll have to come up with an excuse
to ditch those kids at the village. "
 Subaru Natsuki |" Oh, but first, I've gotta learn where all the good
views and flower fields and stuff are... "
 Subaru Natsuki | Crap! I can't sleep while I'm thinking about this! 
 Subaru Natsuki | Oh, I know! 
 Subaru Natsuki | One Puck... Two Pucks... 
 Subaru Natsuki | A hundred and one Pucks... 
 Subaru Natsuki | A new dawn has come! A dawn of hope! 
 Subaru Natsuki | Natsuki Subaru will make giant strides today... 
 Subaru Natsuki | What?! You were in here? 
 Subaru Natsuki | I'm so embarrassed! 
 Subaru Natsuki | You should have said something! 
 Rem |" Sister, Sister... Our guest appears
to be a bit confused. "
 Ram |" Rem, Rem... It looks as though
our guest has gone crazy. "
 Subaru Natsuki | Why are you calling me a guest? 
 Subaru Natsuki | You two and your jokes... 
 Subaru Natsuki | The wounds 
 EXTRA | The Roswaal Mansion Family 
 Subaru Natsuki | are gone. 
 Subaru Natsuki | Why... 
 Subaru Natsuki | Why have I gone back? 
 Rem | Sir, sir, you don't seem to be feeling well. 
 Rem | Are you all right? 
 Ram | Sir, sir, you seem to have a stomachache. 
 Ram | You didn't soil yourself, did you? 
 Subaru Natsuki | You don't... remember me? 
 Subaru Natsuki | So it's like none of it ever happened? 
 Rem | Sir? 
 Ram | Sir? 
 Ram | Sir, you shouldn't try to move so suddenly. 
 Subaru Natsuki |" What happened, damn it?!
Everything reset again! "
 Subaru Natsuki | Including my promise with Emilia! 
 Beatrice | You entered without even knocking? 
 Beatrice | What a rude one you are! 
 Subaru Natsuki | Sorry... 
 Subaru Natsuki | Just let me stay here for a bit, please. 
 Beatrice | There was last time and again now. 
 Beatrice |" How are you breaking
through my Door Crossing? "
 Subaru Natsuki | Beatrice... 
 Beatrice | Addressing me with no title, I suppose? 
 Subaru Natsuki |" You said I broke through your Door Crossing
""last time"" and ""now,"" right? "
 Beatrice |" I just teased you about it, three or four
hours ago, for being so insensitive. "
 Subaru Natsuki |" If this is the second time I've
woken up in the mansion... "
 Subaru Natsuki | Then you remember me, right? 
 Beatrice |" If I could, I'd rather erase you
from my memory, I suppose. "
 Subaru Natsuki |" So the conditions are
different from last time... "
 Subaru Natsuki |" The save point's changed from
near the guy with the appas "
 Subaru Natsuki | to the two angelic girls in maid uniforms. 
 Subaru Natsuki | How did I die? 
 Subaru Natsuki | Everything was normal before I fell asleep. 
 Subaru Natsuki |" Even after I fell asleep, I wasn't in any
situation I felt might be fatal... "
 Beatrice |" I wondered what you were muttering about,
and I hear all this about living and dying. "
 Beatrice |" By human standards, discussing such things
is boring and senseless, I suppose. "
 Beatrice |" In the end, you'll only get
lies and abusive speech. "
 Subaru Natsuki | Thanks, you were a big help. 
 Beatrice | I didn't do anything. 
 Subaru Natsuki |" Somehow, seeing that your attitude
never changes calms me down. "
 Beatrice |" Only an ultimate pervert would be
calmed by verbal abuse, I suppose. "
 Beatrice | You're leaving, I suppose? 
 Subaru Natsuki | Yeah, I want to double check something. 
 Subaru Natsuki | I'll wait until afterward to get depressed. 
 Subaru Natsuki | Yeah, I knew it. 
 Emilia | Subaru! 
 Subaru Natsuki | You're absolutely shining... 
 Emilia | I was worried about you! 
 Emilia | Ram and Rem were in a frenzy, 
 Emilia |" saying you disappeared
right after you woke up! "
 Subaru Natsuki |" Sorry about that... I got held
up by Beatrice for a bit. "
 Emilia |" Again? I heard she played a trick on
you before you woke up, too... "
 Emilia | What is it? 
 Emilia | Is there something on my face? 
 Subaru Natsuki |" Yeah, your adorable eyes,
ears, nose, and mouth. "
 Subaru Natsuki | Uh, I mean... 
 Subaru Natsuki | I'm glad you're okay. 
 Emilia | Yeah, I'm fine. 
 Emilia | You protected me, after all. 
 Emilia | What about you? How are you feeling? 
 Subaru Natsuki | I feel great! 
 Subaru Natsuki | I'm a little low on blood, 
 Subaru Natsuki | all my mana was stolen, 
 Subaru Natsuki | the shock of waking up sapped my strength, 
 Subaru Natsuki |" and I feel like my mind's taken
a fatal beating with a bat, "
 Subaru Natsuki | but I'm good! 
 Emilia | I see, that's g— Huh? 
 Emilia | Wouldn't that mean you're hurt all over? 
 Puck | Hi, Subaru... Great morning, isn't it? 
 Puck | I can't thank you enough for yesterday. 
 Puck | I have to thank you somehow. 
 Subaru Natsuki | Then, let me pet your fur whenever I want! 
 Emilia | That's all? 
 Subaru Natsuki | Okay, let's go! 
 Subaru Natsuki | Our time is limited, and our world is grand. 
 Subaru Natsuki |" And Emilia-tan's and my story
has only just begun! "
 Emilia | True... 
 Emilia | Wait, what did you just say? 
 Emilia |" Where did the ""tan"" come from? "
 Subaru Natsuki | I don't know whose idea of a prank this is, 
 Subaru Natsuki | but I'll make you sorry for all of it. 
 Subaru Natsuki | Don't underestimate how vindictive I'll be, 
 Subaru Natsuki | after the smile that charmed me that night. 
 Subaru Natsuki | I'm going to keep my promise to Emilia! 
 Subaru Natsuki | I'll get past that night! 
 Roswaal L. Mathers | Now, state your desire! 
 Subaru Natsuki | In that case, I have but one request. 
 Subaru Natsuki | Hire me to work in this mansion! 
 Ram | Hic. 
 Subaru Natsuki | It's how these looping plots work. 
 Subaru Natsuki |" Follow the same path, and you'll
end up in the same place. "
 Ram | That's too large for you, Barusu. 
 Ram |" It appears nothing here will
fit except women's clothes. "
 Ram | Rem, alter that one for him. 
 Rem | Yes, Sister. 
 Subaru Natsuki | Take my measurements, then. 
 Subaru Natsuki |" A man can withstand all
kinds of awkwardness! "
 Ram | We'll measure you later. 
 Subaru Natsuki | Huh? 
 Ram | Follow me, Barusu. 
 Subaru Natsuki | Are you going to show me around? 
 Ram | That can wait, as well. 
 Ram | You'll help me with my work first. 
 Subaru Natsuki | Hey, wait! 
 Subaru Natsuki | Retrace the same path I took yesterday... 
 Subaru Natsuki | That's what I meant to do, but... 
 Subaru Natsuki | This is totally different from last time. 
 Subaru Natsuki | It's like making a cheat sheet, 
 Subaru Natsuki |" but when you see the answers,
you realize it's the wrong subject. "
 Subaru Natsuki | A total waste of effort. 
 Roswaal L. Mathers | Hi, there! May I join— 
 Subaru Natsuki | No, you may not. 
 Roswaal L. Mathers | This facility is part of my mansion, 
 Roswaal L. Mathers | so it is my property... 
 Roswaal L. Mathers | I shall do with it as I please. 
 Subaru Natsuki | Why bother asking, then? 
 Subaru Natsuki | If you want, take a bath. 
 Roswaal L. Mathers | My, how harsh! 
 Roswaal L. Mathers | And you seem not to understand. 
 Roswaal L. Mathers | Yes, this bath is my property... 
 Roswaal L. Mathers | But as part of my staff, 
 Roswaal L. Mathers | are you not my property, as well? 
 Subaru Natsuki | Chomp. 
 Roswaal L. Mathers | No hesitation at all! 
 Subaru Natsuki |" This is turning out different
from what I'd expected, too. "
 Roswaal L. Mathers | I do not know what's bothering you, 
 Roswaal L. Mathers |" but life is full of things
that fail to go your way. "
 Roswaal L. Mathers | Speaking of which, 
 Roswaal L. Mathers |" do you think you'll be able to
get along with Ram and Rem? "
 Subaru Natsuki | I haven't spoken to Rem much yet, 
 Subaru Natsuki | but I get along fine with Ram. 
 Subaru Natsuki |" In fact, I think she might be
getting a little too friendly. "
 Subaru Natsuki |" I can't believe she can work
as a maid that way. "
 Roswaal L. Mathers | Well, Rem covers what Ram cannot. 
 Roswaal L. Mathers | As sisters, they must help each other. 
 Roswaal L. Mathers |" In that sense, I think
they get by quite well. "
 Subaru Natsuki |" Ram is just the inferior
version of her sister, "
 Subaru Natsuki | and all Rem does is cover for her... 
 Subaru Natsuki |" And yet they insist Ram is superior
because she's older. "
 Subaru Natsuki | Their nerve is almost scary. 
 Roswaal L. Mathers |" Speaking of nerve, yours appears
quite impressive, as well! "
 Subaru Natsuki | Damn, I'm dizzy from that bath. 
 Subaru Natsuki | Stupid Roswaal... 
 Ram | Cover up that sorry thing. 
 Subaru Natsuki | Why are you here? 
 Ram |" I was only waiting to help
Roswaal-sama put on fresh clothes. "
 Ram | I'm sorry to say that I've finished my bath, 
 Ram | so I won't be changing. 
 Subaru Natsuki | I wasn't thinking about that! 
 Subaru Natsuki |" Also, you spoil him too much!
Let him dress himself! "
 Ram |" I will not condone disrespect
toward Roswaal-sama. "
 Ram | Next time, I will use force. 
 Subaru Natsuki |" Any more, and I'll just
stir up a hornet's nest... "
 Ram |" By the way, Barusu,
do you have plans after this? "
 Subaru Natsuki | No, just going to sleep. 
 Ram |" Then please wait in your room.
I'll come by later. "
 Subaru Natsuki | Huh? 
 Subaru Natsuki |" She didn't mean anything...
She didn't mean anything by it. "
 Subaru Natsuki |" Clear my mind, clear my mind!
Emilia-tan is the only one for me! "
 Subaru Natsuki | Calm down, calm down... 
 Subaru Natsuki |" One Emilia-tan, two Emilia-tans,
three Emilia-tans... "
 Subaru Natsuki | Am I in Heaven?! 
 Ram | You're too noisy, Barusu. 
 Ram | It's nighttime. Be quiet. 
 Subaru Natsuki | Eep! 
 Ram | Barusu, come over here. 
 Subaru Natsuki |" Wait, my heart's already set on
someone named ""Emilia-tan""! "
 Ram | What are you talking about? 
 Ram |" I told you to sit here, so I can
teach you to read and write. "
 Subaru Natsuki | That's news to me! 
 Subaru Natsuki | But where's this coming from? 
 Ram |" I could tell by watching you that
you can't read or write. "
 Ram |" If you can't read or write,
I can't send you shopping, "
 Ram | and you can't write down orders. 
 Ram |" We'll start with this collection
of children's fairy tales. "
 Ram |" Starting tonight, I'll help
you study every evening. "
 Subaru Natsuki | Why are you being so nice to me? 
 Ram | Why else? It's so that I... 
 Ram | No, it's so I can get off easy. 
 Subaru Natsuki | That wasn't correcting yourself! 
 Subaru Natsuki | You're never out of character, are you? 
 Ram | Well, isn't it obvious? 
 Ram | The more you can do, 
 Ram | the less I have to do. 
 Ram | And when I have less to do, so does Rem. 
 Ram | It's win-win. 
 Subaru Natsuki | But that leaves me with piles of work! 
 Ram | We'll start with the basic i-glyphs. 
 Ram |" After you master them, we'll move
to ro-glyphs and ha-glyphs. "
 Subaru Natsuki | There are three different types? 
 Subaru Natsuki | Just hearing that is depressing... 
 EXTRA |" Natsuki Subaru

On the scene!! "
 Ram | You don't have time to waste on doodles. 
 Ram | Tomorrow's an early start, so time's short. 
 Subaru Natsuki | I'm sleepy, too. 
 Subaru Natsuki |" I can't say I dislike how you insert your
own feelings at the end, Senpai. "
 Ram |" I do believe honesty is my
most charming feature. "
 Ram | Now, let's begin. 
 Subaru Natsuki |" It's so monotonous, I feel a Gestaltzerfall
phenomenon coming on... "
 Subaru Natsuki |" But still, even if it's to make your
life easier, it makes me happy. "
 Subaru Natsuki |" Honestly, I had the feeling
you didn't like me much. "
 Subaru Natsuki |" And I'll probably cause more problems
for you down the line. "
 Subaru Natsuki |" But I'll try to become
useful as soon as I can. "
 Subaru Natsuki | Wow... I hate to admit it, but it's perfect. 
 Subaru Natsuki |" Guess there's no need for my
sewing skills this time... "
 Rem | Sewing skills? 
 Rem | Do you like sewing? 
 Subaru Natsuki | Kinda. 
 Subaru Natsuki |" By the way, it looks like Ros-chi and
Emilia-tan have lots of outfits, "
 Subaru Natsuki | but I don't see any for you and Rem-rin. 
 Subaru Natsuki |" Want me to sew some for you?
I'll take your measurements. "
 Rem | That is unnecessary. 
 Rem | These uniforms are all my sister and I need. 
 Subaru Natsuki | How can you have nothing but those uniforms? 
 Subaru Natsuki | Are all your clothes maid outfits? 
 Rem |" They cause no problems when we accompany
Roswaal-sama on business, "
 Rem | or when we work in the mansion. 
 Rem |" They also eliminate the need to explain
our place in the hierarchy, "
 Rem | which makes them very logical. 
 Subaru Natsuki | But it's not about being logical. 
 Subaru Natsuki | I'm trying to say cute girls 
 Subaru Natsuki |" have a duty to dress up, so they
please the eyes of others. "
 Rem | My sister is one thing, 
 Rem | but no one would be happy to see me dress up. 
 Subaru Natsuki | Well, I would. 
 Rem | Would any good come of making you happy? 
 Subaru Natsuki | I might take more pride in my work here, 
 Subaru Natsuki | which could boost my productivity. 
 Rem | I have no idea what makes you say that. 
 Subaru Natsuki |" I'd also look forward to
seeing the differences "
 Subaru Natsuki | in your sartorial choices... 
 Rem | That is none of your concern. 
 Rem |" Does my looking the same as my sister
somehow inconvenience you? "
 Subaru Natsuki | You love your sister way too much. 
 Subaru Natsuki | Ow! 
 Ram | You don't know how to handle a knife, Barusu. 
 Subaru Natsuki | I know... 
 Subaru Natsuki |" You hold the knife still and
turn the vegetable, right? "
 Subaru Natsuki |" It's embarrassing when you
stare at me so intently... "
 Ram | Your unsightly appearance stands out. 
 Ram | Especially your hair. It's very unrefined. 
 Subaru Natsuki |" I thought I did a pretty good job
of cutting it by myself. "
 Ram |" By the way, in this mansion,
Rem sees to everyone's hair. "
 Ram |" She styles my hair and dresses me
every morning, too. Isn't it nice? "
 Subaru Natsuki | Try to contribute a little, Sis! 
 Ram | Rem... 
 Ram |" If you like, you can tidy up
Barusu's hair a bit. "
 Rem | Sister? 
 Subaru Natsuki | Whoa, whoa... 
 Subaru Natsuki |" Having a girl mess with my hair
will get me all worked up— "
 Ram |" You keep looking at Barusu because
his hair bothers you, right? "
 Rem | Yes, that is correct. 
 Rem | I think combing it and evening out the ends 
 Rem | would make him more presentable. 
 Ram | You heard her. 
 Ram | You should take her up on her offer. 
 Ram | Her hands will take you to paradise. 
 Subaru Natsuki | You make it sound so dirty... 
 Subaru Natsuki |" If you don't want to,
you should just tell her. "
 Subaru Natsuki | Not that I don't want you to, but... 
 Rem | No, that isn't it. 
 Rem |" The truth is that it did
bother me a little... "
 Rem | very much, a little... extremely, a little. 
 Subaru Natsuki |" Well, anyway, that proves the
point that it bothers you. "
 Puck | What's the matter, Betty? 
 Beatrice | Nothing, Bubby. 
 Beatrice |" More importantly, I have delicious
sweets today, I suppose. "
 Beatrice | Eat them with me! 
 Puck | Yum! 
 Subaru Natsuki | What's up? Here to help me? 
 Rem |" No, this is about what we
discussed at lunchtime. "
 Subaru Natsuki | Lunchtime? Oh, about my hair? 
 Subaru Natsuki | You'll really style it for me? 
 Rem |" No, I felt that I said some things
that were uncalled for. "
 Rem | I am very sorry. 
 Rem |" We may be colleagues,
but as Emilia-sama's savior, "
 Rem | your rank surpasses mine. 
 Subaru Natsuki | That's how you feel? 
 Subaru Natsuki | Sorry to put you through that. 
 Rem |" No, I should apologize for saying
something so pointless. "
 Rem | Please forget it. 
 Subaru Natsuki | I guess it's never that easy. 
 Subaru Natsuki | That's what makes being human so hard. 
 Subaru Natsuki | Okay, I'll give you a condition, then! 
 Subaru Natsuki |" If you agree to it, I'll forget
everything you just said. "
 Rem | A condition? 
 Rem | Very well, I shall hear you out. 
 Subaru Natsuki |" If you comb my hair a bit and even
out the ends, I'll let it slide! "
 Subaru Natsuki |" When you respond with silence,
it actually hurts even more... "
 Rem | It is just as Emilia-sama said. 
 Rem | You have no ambition at all. 
 Subaru Natsuki | It's weird... 
 Subaru Natsuki |" I'd think that'd make you fall for me
all over again, not disgust you. "
 Rem |" My sister said your eyes take on an obscene
look when she's alone with you. "
 Rem |" So to be honest, I was prepared
to hear you suggest that. "
 Subaru Natsuki | She's killing my reputation! 
 Rem | I accept your condition. 
 Rem | I shall do as you wish. 
 Subaru Natsuki |" Then, after I keep my promise
to Emilia-tan would be great. "
 Rem | Promise? 
 Subaru Natsuki | Well, I haven't made the promise yet. 
 Subaru Natsuki |" Scoping out our date destination before I
make the promise might be smart... "
 Subaru Natsuki | I've researched places with the best views! 
 Subaru Natsuki | That just leaves... 
 Subaru Natsuki | ...this. 
 EXTRA | He's back! 
 EXTRA | And his face looks weird again! 
 Subaru Natsuki | I need to make sure these guys don't find us. 
 EXTRA | What do you mean by find you? 
 EXTRA | Did you pee your pants? 
 EXTRA | We're playing hide-and-seek? 
 Subaru Natsuki | Chill, brats! I played with you earlier! 
 EXTRA | Let's play more! 
 EXTRA | Play! Play! 
 EXTRA | Change your pants! 
 Subaru Natsuki | All right, listen up. 
 Subaru Natsuki | Next time I come here, I'll be on a date. 
 Subaru Natsuki | Try to take a hint, okay? 
 Subaru Natsuki |" I'll allow this little critter to play
with Emilia-tan, though. "
 Subaru Natsuki | Ow! Again?! 
 Rem | Subaru-kun, so this is where you were. 
 Rem | Are you all right? 
 Subaru Natsuki | I'm fine, I'm fine... 
 Subaru Natsuki | All done shopping, Rem-rin? 
 Rem | Yes, it went quite smoothly. 
 EXTRA | Aw, you're leaving? 
 EXTRA | Don't go! 
 EXTRA | You have somewhere to go home to? 
 Rem | You were quite popular with them. 
 Subaru Natsuki |" For some reason,
kids have always liked me... "
 Rem | Like animals, children observe a hierarchy. 
 Rem |" They can tell if it's all right
to belittle someone. "
 Subaru Natsuki | Those brats... 
 Subaru Natsuki | They have no respect. 
 Rem |" Did you show them anything
about you worth respecting? "
 Subaru Natsuki | That's a sound argument. 
 Subaru Natsuki |" Still, it doesn't seem right to
belittle me from the start. "
 Subaru Natsuki |" Ram seems like she'd handle
that kind of thing well. "
 Rem | My sister is wonderful, isn't she? 
 Subaru Natsuki | Honestly, I'd think her personality 
 Subaru Natsuki | would cause conflict more often than not. 
 Rem |" My sister's self-assured nature is
what makes her so charming. "
 Rem | I cannot be that way at all. 
 Rem | By the way, how are your studies progressing? 
 Subaru Natsuki | Let's just say I'm plugging along. 
 Subaru Natsuki | Ram is actually a pretty good teacher, too. 
 Subaru Natsuki |" Though I wish she wouldn't sleep
on my bed in mid-lesson. "
 Subaru Natsuki | It kinda kills my motivation. 
 Rem |" My sister only acts that way to
stimulate your motivation. "
 Subaru Natsuki |" Why do you have such absolute
faith in your sister? "
 Subaru Natsuki | That isn't normal... 
 Subaru Natsuki | You're totally fanatical like a demon. 
 Rem | Fanatical like a demon? 
 Subaru Natsuki | It's the demon version of divine possession. 
 Subaru Natsuki | Sounds kinda cool, right? 
 Rem | Do you like demons? 
 Subaru Natsuki | Well, gods generally don't do anything, 
 Subaru Natsuki |" but demons will laugh along when
you talk about future plans. "
 Subaru Natsuki | Especially for next year and stuff. 
 Subaru Natsuki | They'll laugh their heads off. 
 Subaru Natsuki | That smile is a million volts! 
 Rem | I'm going to tell Emilia-sama. 
 Subaru Natsuki | I wasn't trying to hit on you! 
 Emilia |" Both Ram and Rem said they wouldn't
be coming to see you tonight, "
 Emilia | so I agreed to help with your studies. 
 Emilia | I'm afraid I can't do much, though. 
 Subaru Natsuki |" Right now, I'm writing the basic i-glyphs
until I memorize them... "
 Emilia |" Wow! You're studying a lot more
intensely than I imagined! "
 Subaru Natsuki | S-Since these fairy tales are aimed at kids, 
 Subaru Natsuki | it's mostly i-glyphs, or so they said... 
 Subaru Natsuki |" So my goal for now is to
be able... to read this... "
 Subaru Natsuki | Anyway, um... 
 Subaru Natsuki | Th-The moon sure is pretty. 
 Emilia | Huh? 
 Subaru Natsuki | No! I mean, um, I have a favor to ask you. 
 Subaru Natsuki | Will you listen? 
 Subaru Natsuki |" Starting tomorrow, I'll work
hard, and I'll study, too! "
 Subaru Natsuki | Go on a date with me. 
 Emilia | What does a date entail? 
 Subaru Natsuki |" When a guy and a girl go out alone
together, that's a date! "
 Subaru Natsuki |" Only the goddess of love knows what
will happen during that time... "
 Emilia |" Then that means you went on a
date with Rem today, right? "
 Subaru Natsuki | Ugh! I didn't expect that response! 
 Subaru Natsuki | That didn't count! Please don't count that! 
 Emilia |" I understand that you want us to
go out together, but where? "
 Subaru Natsuki |" Actually, there's this really cute
little dog in the nearby village. "
 Subaru Natsuki | There's a flower field, too. 
 Subaru Natsuki | I want to see you in a field of flowers, 
 Subaru Natsuki |" and capture the image for
eternity with my metia! "
 Emilia | Oh, um... The village, huh? 
 Subaru Natsuki | The dog is super cute! Let's go! 
 Emilia |" But it might cause trouble for
you. And for the villagers— "
 Subaru Natsuki |" The kids are so pure and innocent,
they're like angels! Let's go! "
 Emilia | Oh, all right. You leave me no choice. 
 Emilia | I'll go with you. 
 Subaru Natsuki |" And the flower field is super colorful
and wonderfu— Really? "
 Emilia |" If that will motivate you to work hard
from tomorrow on, then I will. "
 Subaru Natsuki | All right! 
 Emilia | I bet the weather will be lovely tomorrow. 
 Subaru Natsuki | Yeah... And it'll be a day I'll never forget. 
 Emilia | There you go again with... 
 Emilia | You were just... 
 Emilia | Never mind. 
 Subaru Natsuki |" You know, it makes a guy really anxious
when you don't finish your sentences. "
 Emilia | Okay, Subaru-kun the butler, 
 Emilia | remember to work hard. 
 Emilia | Only those who work hard are rewarded, 
 Emilia | so this will be a reward! 
 Subaru Natsuki | All right, let's settle this, fate... 
 Subaru Natsuki | I won't sleep tonight, no matter what. 
 Subaru Natsuki |" I'll stay awake to greet the
morning of my promise. "
 Subaru Natsuki |" Jeez... What am I, a grade schooler who
can't sleep before a class outing? "
 Subaru Natsuki |" Reminds me of when I overslept
on the day of the class trip... "
 Subaru Natsuki |" I wasn't able to retrace
the same loop exactly, "
 Subaru Natsuki | but I got along well with Ram and Rem. 
 Subaru Natsuki | In fact, I think I did better than last time. 
 Subaru Natsuki | If there's anything I feel I missed, 
 Subaru Natsuki | it's not saying goodnight to Beatrice. 
 Subaru Natsuki |" Each time I saw her, all we
did was insult each other. "
 Subaru Natsuki |" But maybe I should have...
at least... thanked her... "
 Subaru Natsuki | What is this? 
 Subaru Natsuki | I'm so cold... 
 Subaru Natsuki | No... Could this be... 
 Subaru Natsuki | Someone... 
 Subaru Natsuki | Someone... Help. 
 Subaru Natsuki | What just... 
 EXTRA | The Morning of Our Is Still Distant 
 Subaru Natsuki | My left arm! 
 Subaru Natsuki | I still have it? 
 Subaru Natsuki | I went back again... 
 Subaru Natsuki | No, maybe I should say I made it back... 
 Subaru Natsuki | Oh, sorry. Good morning. 
 Subaru Natsuki | Right, I guess you don't remember me... 
 Subaru Natsuki | Sorry for the trouble I've caused! 
 Subaru Natsuki | Natsuki Subaru will now start over! 
 Subaru Natsuki | By the way, what day and time is it? 
 Subaru Natsuki | It's my third first day in the Roswaal mansion. 
 Subaru Natsuki | That chill I felt... 
 Subaru Natsuki |" Does that mean I died in my sleep the
first time, due to physical weakness? "
 Subaru Natsuki | But the second time, 
 Subaru Natsuki | there was an attacker. 
 Subaru Natsuki | So if I was killed, 
 Subaru Natsuki |" does that mean the others in
the mansion are targets, too? "
 Subaru Natsuki |" Because we're involved in Emilia's royal
selection, like at the loot house? "
 Subaru Natsuki | But even if I know that, 
 Subaru Natsuki |" I have no proof to explain it
or any way to avoid it. "
 Subaru Natsuki |" Worse yet, I didn't see the
attacker's face, or their prey. "
 Subaru Natsuki | My death was totally in vain. 
 Beatrice | You're irritating me to death. 
 Beatrice | Either stop it or be blown away. 
 Subaru Natsuki | Oh, sorry... 
 Subaru Natsuki |" But somehow, walking in circles also
turns the gears in my head. "
 Subaru Natsuki | Cut me some slack, huh? 
 Subaru Natsuki | We're tight, aren't we? 
 Beatrice |" Exactly what sort of relationship do
you think we have, I suppose? "
 Beatrice | We've only met twice. 
 Subaru Natsuki | Well, I won't make trouble for you. 
 Subaru Natsuki | Serve some tea or something, and let me relax. 
 Beatrice | As if I'll serve you anything, I suppose. 
 Beatrice | Ugh, you're irritating me! 
 Subaru Natsuki | What's that book you're reading? 
 Beatrice |" It explains how to get rid of bugs that
have gotten into my room, I suppose. "
 Subaru Natsuki | You've got bugs in the library? That sucks. 
 Subaru Natsuki | What kind of bugs? 
 Beatrice | It's time for you to leave! 
 Beatrice | Your hands have stopped shaking, 
 Beatrice | so you can mask your fear now, I suppose. 
 Subaru Natsuki | You could tell? 
 Beatrice | You were trying to hide it, I suppose. 
 Beatrice |" It's quite vexing to be treated
as a mere convenience. "
 Subaru Natsuki | You're not nice at all... 
 Subaru Natsuki | Thanks for the help, though. 
 Subaru Natsuki | I'll be counting on you again. 
 Beatrice | I don't want to be counted on, I suppose. 
 Beatrice | So don't come in here again! 
 Beatrice | Shoo, shoo. 
 Subaru Natsuki |" ""Shoo, shoo""? "
 Subaru Natsuki |" Wait! When you said ""bugs,"" you meant me? "
 Beatrice | Just get out of here this instant! 
 Subaru Natsuki |" I-If not for the flower bed, that would
have been instant death... "
 Emilia | Um... 
 Emilia | Can I ask if you're all right? 
 Subaru Natsuki |" Emilia-tan, your kindness is the
one thing that can heal me. "
 Emilia |" You know, Rem just spread manure
in that flower bed yesterday. "
 Subaru Natsuki | Argh! 
 Subaru Natsuki |" Three-second rule! That didn't count...
That didn't count, right? "
 Emilia |" In fact, they say this kind
of thing is actually lucky. "
 Subaru Natsuki |" Emilia-tan is already shifting
into consolation mode... "
 Emilia | Puck, wake up. 
 Puck | Morning, Lia... 
 Emilia | Morning, Puck. 
 Emilia |" Sorry to ask after you just woke up,
but could you wash Subaru off? "
 Puck | Subaru? 
 Puck | Okay, I'll wash you off. 
 Puck | Here! 
 Puck | There, all clean. 
 Puck | Isn't that nice? 
 Subaru Natsuki | I thought I was a goner... 
 Subaru Natsuki | Wasn't there another way to do that? 
 Subaru Natsuki | You enjoyed that, didn't you? 
 Puck | That isn't true at all... Hmph. 
 Puck | Punch-backs! 
 Subaru Natsuki | Now, you've done it! 
 Subaru Natsuki |" Like that? It's my lethal move,
Make the Cat Cry Ha Ha... "
 Puck | Cut it out! 
 Puck | Tail punch! 
 Subaru Natsuki | You— 
 Puck | And I'll finish you with my paw-pad grind! 
 Puck | Grind, grind, grind, grind... 
 Emilia | Oh, gosh... Sorry, I can't... 
 Emilia | What are you two doing? 
 Emilia | Oh, my stomach... I'm dying... 
 Subaru Natsuki |" Well, now that I've rebounded from
my initial bad impression... "
 Subaru Natsuki | Thanks for your assistance, Father! 
 Puck |" Who are you calling ""Father""? "
 Puck | I won't give you my daughter that easily. 
 Emilia | Please stop. You're both too funny... 
 Puck | Nothing beats your smile, Lia. 
 Puck | You agree, too. Right, Subaru? 
 Subaru Natsuki | I totally do. 
 Subaru Natsuki |" To me, Emilia-tan's smile is the first
shining star in the night sky! "
 Emilia | Not you, too, Subaru. 
 Emilia |" Also, what does ""tan"" mean?
Where'd it come from? "
 Subaru Natsuki | It's what they call a pet name. 
 Subaru Natsuki |" Just like when Puck calls you ""Lia."" "
 Subaru Natsuki |" It's an expression of affection
that shows people's closeness. "
 Emilia | I don't remember getting so close to you... 
 Subaru Natsuki | That somewhat hurts, but I won't lose heart! 
 Subaru Natsuki | Think of it as an advance on our relationship. 
 Subaru Natsuki |" It means I want us to get close enough
to call each other by pet names. "
 Subaru Natsuki | Okay? 
 Emilia | All right, I'll accept that. 
 Emilia | No... Don't look at me. 
 Subaru Natsuki |" I expected her to cringe,
but I got a positive response. "
 Subaru Natsuki |" What could this mean,
Commentator Puck-san? "
 Puck | She doesn't have many friends, 
 Puck | so she craves things like nicknames. 
 Puck | She's easy to please. 
 Subaru Natsuki | My main heroine is easy to please, huh?! 
 Rem | Sister, Sister... It's only been a short time, 
 Rem | and now our guest looks like a drowned rat. 
 Ram | Rem, Rem. In just a short time, 
 Ram | our guest has turned into a dirty, old washrag. 
 Subaru Natsuki | I know I'm a rat. You don't have to tell me. 
 Ram | Our lord, Roswaal-sama, has returned. 
 Rem | Our lord, Roswaal-sama, has returned. 
 Rem | Please come inside. 
 Ram | Please come inside. 
 Subaru Natsuki | Here we go. 
 Subaru Natsuki |" My third first meeting with
the lord of the mansion. "
 Subaru Natsuki |" All I know for certain is that someone
will attack on the fourth night. "
 Subaru Natsuki | It'd be ideal if I could let them know. 
 Subaru Natsuki | But I can't explain where I got the information, 
 Subaru Natsuki |" so they might think I'm working
with the assassin. "
 Subaru Natsuki | If I just knew even the attacker's physique, 
 Subaru Natsuki | it might be a different story. 
 Subaru Natsuki | So this time, I'll use these next four days 
 Subaru Natsuki |" to gather information and
learn who the attacker is. "
 Subaru Natsuki | And to do that... 
 Roswaal L. Mathers | You may have any reward you request. 
 Roswaal L. Mathers | Merely state your desire! 
 Subaru Natsuki | In that case, 
 Subaru Natsuki | let me live here as a house guest, 
 Subaru Natsuki | and eat and sleep all I want! 
 Subaru Natsuki | But how am I supposed to gather information? 
 Subaru Natsuki |" I guess I'll start with some
indirect questioning... "
 Subaru Natsuki | That's where I fell. 
 Subaru Natsuki | Sorry for the trouble... 
 Rem | Of course. If you'll excuse me, sir. 
 Subaru Natsuki | Wait. 
 Subaru Natsuki | I didn't even get a chance to talk. 
 Subaru Natsuki | I don't see anything out of the ordinary... 
 Roswaal L. Mathers | What do you not see? 
 Subaru Natsuki | Ros-chi... 
 Subaru Natsuki | Don't scare me like that. It's misleading. 
 EXTRA |" Magic - died of weakness in sleep
Sound of chains
Roswaal's chains X
Misleading!! "
 Subaru Natsuki | Come in! 
 Ram | Here you go, sir. 
 Subaru Natsuki | Oh, thanks. Want to drink it with me? 
 Ram | No, thank you, sir. 
 Subaru Natsuki |" Hey, you can be a little friendlier
to me if you want... "
 Subaru Natsuki |" Well, it's my first day.
I guess it makes sense. "
 Subaru Natsuki | Yo! 
 Beatrice |" Every day, you come in here
without even knocking. "
 Beatrice | You truly have no manners whatsoever. 
 Beatrice |" Leaving would be in your best interest,
before you get blown away, I suppose. "
 Subaru Natsuki | Whoa! Wait, wait... 
 Subaru Natsuki | I just want to ask you something. 
 Subaru Natsuki |" Is there any magic that weakens and kills
someone, as if putting them to sleep? "
 Beatrice | If I must answer, then yes, there is. 
 Subaru Natsuki | There is? 
 Beatrice |" But it isn't so much magic as
it is a curse, I suppose. "
 Beatrice |" There are many such things among the
spells that shamans specialize in. "
 Subaru Natsuki | Shamans? 
 Beatrice | Magicians. 
 Beatrice |" However, shamans are a subclass
of magic- and spirit-arts users, "
 Beatrice |" originating in the northern nation
of Gusteco, I suppose. "
 Beatrice |" They're all quite useless, and not
to be taken seriously. "
 Beatrice |" But there is an easier method
than a curse, I suppose. "
 Subaru Natsuki | Easier? 
 Beatrice | I believe you've already experienced it. 
 Subaru Natsuki | Wait, you mean... 
 Subaru Natsuki |" That mana drain you did against
my will could actually kill me? "
 Beatrice | Mana is also one's very life force. 
 Beatrice |" If you continually suck it out, one could
die of weakness, I suppose. "
 Subaru Natsuki |" Wait... You're not the one
who killed me, are you? "
 Beatrice | Sorry to disappoint you, but I'm busy. 
 Beatrice | I couldn't even spare the effort to kill you... 
 Subaru Natsuki | Is this what you want? 
 Subaru Natsuki | So, uh... 
 Subaru Natsuki | Oh, yeah. 
 Subaru Natsuki | Can anyone do that mana-sucking thing? 
 Beatrice |" That's an absolutely terrible
way to put it, I suppose. "
 Beatrice | In this mansion, only Bubby and I can. 
 Beatrice | Even Roswaal can't. 
 Subaru Natsuki | Oh... It's actually a pretty rare skill, then. 
 Subaru Natsuki | Don't suck up that stuff too much. 
 Subaru Natsuki | Especially from me. 
 Subaru Natsuki |" I'm really short on blood right now,
so I'd die in a heartbeat. "
 Beatrice | Yes, all your organs were restored, 
 Beatrice | but your blood wasn't replaced, I suppose. 
 Beatrice | Well, I have no obligation to do so, anyway. 
 Subaru Natsuki | My organs? 
 Subaru Natsuki | The way you said that 
 Subaru Natsuki |" makes it sound like you were the
one who healed my wounds. "
 Subaru Natsuki |" Trying to take the credit from Emilia-tan
makes you look bad! "
 Beatrice |" That silly girl doesn't have the power
to heal fatal wounds yet, I suppose. "
 Subaru Natsuki | Eh? 
 Beatrice |" She and Bubby stabilized you,
and I healed your wounds. "
 Subaru Natsuki | Huh?! 
 Subaru Natsuki | F-For real? You're kidding, right? 
 Subaru Natsuki | Of course... It's a lie. 
 Subaru Natsuki | It was a lie! It's not nice to lie! 
 Subaru Natsuki | No lying... 
 Beatrice | Shut up, I suppose. 
 Beatrice | You're too averse to the truth. 
 Beatrice |" Someone not worth saving should
disappear, I suppose! "
 Emilia | Um... 
 Emilia | Once again, are you all right? 
 Subaru Natsuki |" So, in the end, the key words
are ""curse"" and ""chains."" "
 Subaru Natsuki | I don't know anything else. 
 Subaru Natsuki | If Return by Death's conditions are the same, 
 Subaru Natsuki |" I died three times in the capital,
and survived the fourth time. "
 Subaru Natsuki |" But that doesn't mean I intend to
treat this as a throwaway life. "
 Subaru Natsuki |" That's why I asked Puck to keep
an eye on Emilia for me. "
 Puck | Sure. 
 Puck | This is all really vague, 
 Puck |" but I can tell you're asking
out of concern for Lia. "
 Subaru Natsuki |" On the morning of the fourth day,
I'll leave here and— "
 EXTRA |" Magic - died of weakness in sleep
Sound of chains
Roswaal's chains X
Misleading!! "
 Ram | Pardon my intrusion, sir. 
 Ram | I see you really are studying, sir. 
 Subaru Natsuki | That's super rude... 
 Subaru Natsuki | I am a guest here, you know. 
 Ram | You're a freeloader calling yourself a guest. 
 Ram | That's how I perceive it, sir. 
 Subaru Natsuki | Thanks. 
 Subaru Natsuki | Ugh, it's still nasty. 
 Ram |" You'll incur the wrath of the
mansion's finest tea leaves. "
 Subaru Natsuki | Slacking off right in front of your guest? 
 Subaru Natsuki | I have no words for that nerve of yours. 
 Ram |" You were the one who told me to
be more friendly toward you. "
 Ram | I'm only responding to your demand. 
 Ram | So? How is your studying coming? 
 Subaru Natsuki | Not bad... 
 Subaru Natsuki | I can read simple fairy tales like these now. 
 Subaru Natsuki |" It's interesting how the morals slightly
differ from those of the ones I know. "
 Subaru Natsuki | It's like true cross-cultural communication! 
 Subaru Natsuki |" Maybe I should import a few fairy
tales from my homeland. "
 Subaru Natsuki |" Like ""The Red Ogre Who Cried."" "
 Ram | The Red Ogre Who Cried? 
 Subaru Natsuki | Want me to tell it to you? 
 Subaru Natsuki | All right, your attention, please. 
 Subaru Natsuki |" Once upon a time, there lived
a red ogre and a blue ogre. "
 Subaru Natsuki | The two were very good friends. 
 Subaru Natsuki |" The red ogre wanted to be friends
with the people of the village. "
 Subaru Natsuki |" But the people were too scared
to get close to him. "
 Subaru Natsuki | The blue ogre couldn't bear to watch, 
 Subaru Natsuki | so he devised a plan to help his friend. 
 Subaru Natsuki |" ""I'll make a ruckus in the village,
so you come and stop me. "
 Subaru Natsuki |" Then the villagers will be sure to trust you."" "
 Subaru Natsuki |" The plan worked, and the red
ogre befriended the humans. "
 Subaru Natsuki |" But as time passed,
something began to worry him. "
 Subaru Natsuki |" His friend, the blue ogre,
no longer came to visit him. "
 Subaru Natsuki |" One day, the red ogre went
to the blue ogre's house. "
 Subaru Natsuki |" The door was tightly shut, and a
letter was affixed to it. "
 Subaru Natsuki | The letter said... 
 Subaru Natsuki |" ""Red Ogre-kun, please have fun
with your human friends. "
 Subaru Natsuki | If I continue to hang around you, 
 Subaru Natsuki | they might think you're a bad ogre, too. 
 Subaru Natsuki | So I've decided to go on a journey, 
 Subaru Natsuki | but I will never forget you. 
 Subaru Natsuki | Goodbye. Please take care of yourself. 
 Subaru Natsuki | Your friend forever... 
 Subaru Natsuki |" Blue Ogre."" "
 Subaru Natsuki |" The red ogre read the letter in
silence, over and over again. "
 Subaru Natsuki | Tears fell, as he began to cry. 
 Subaru Natsuki | The end. 
 Ram | That's a sad story. 
 Subaru Natsuki | Yeah, it is. 
 Subaru Natsuki | But I think it's a sweet story, too. 
 Ram | I think all the characters in it are just stupid. 
 Ram |" The red ogre, the blue ogre,
and the villagers, too. "
 Subaru Natsuki | That's kind of a harsh critique. 
 Subaru Natsuki | I mean, I'm not denying it, but... 
 Subaru Natsuki | That's why I both love and hate that story. 
 Subaru Natsuki |" The blue ogre's self-sacrifice
is really appealing, "
 Subaru Natsuki |" but it's stupid because
he gets nothing in return. "
 Subaru Natsuki |" I'm the type that wants to be
rewarded for my effort. "
 Ram | Is that what you think of the blue ogre? 
 Ram | But it's the red ogre that I think is beyond help. 
 Ram | He dragged the blue ogre into his own desires. 
 Ram | As a result, he lost nothing. 
 Ram | Only the blue ogre lost anything. 
 Subaru Natsuki |" Then what do you think the two
ogres should have done? "
 Ram |" If the red ogre truly wanted
to befriend the humans, "
 Ram |" he should have broken off his
horns and gone to them. "
 Ram |" He should have done that before the
blue ogre couldn't bear to watch anymore. "
 Subaru Natsuki | That's a pretty extreme opinion, too... 
 Ram | Is it? 
 Ram |" Which of the two ogres would
you rather be friends with? "
 Subaru Natsuki | Which of the two? 
 Ram |" The red ogre, who can only wish
and be taken care of by others, "
 Ram |" or the stupid blue ogre,
who basks in self-sacrifice? "
 Ram | What a foolish answer. 
 Ram | If you want to befriend both, 
 Ram | you must be the indecisive, adulterous type. 
 Ram | You'll regret it one day. 
 Subaru Natsuki | I don't recall it being that kind of story! 
 Ram | Putting aside your homeland's fairy tales, 
 Ram |" did any of these stories leave
an impression on you? "
 Subaru Natsuki | Well, the ones that interested me most 
 Subaru Natsuki | were the middle one, about the dragon, 
 Subaru Natsuki | and at the end, about the witch. 
 Subaru Natsuki |" I finally know where the name the ""Dragon's
Kingdom of Lugunica"" comes from. "
 Ram | Oh? 
 Subaru Natsuki |" It said the royal family signed
a covenant with a dragon, "
 Subaru Natsuki |" so it's more like a folk tale
than a fairy tale, right? "
 Ram | Yes, since it's true. 
 Ram |" The noble dragon still protects
this nation from far away, "
 Ram | beyond a great waterfall. 
 Ram |" It will do so until its contract with
the royal family is fulfilled. "
 Subaru Natsuki |" Wait, didn't the royal family that signed
the contract recently die out? "
 Ram | Yes, quite abruptly. 
 Ram | No one knows what the dragon wants. 
 Ram |" In the nation's current situation,
only the gods know... "
 Ram |" No, only the dragon knows what
the dragon will do, sir. "
 Subaru Natsuki | Oh, by the way, about this witch story— 
 Ram | I don't want to discuss that. 
 Ram | I've stayed too long. 
 Ram |" I'll come again to notify you
when dinner is ready, sir. "
 Subaru Natsuki | O-Okay. 
 Ram | That story you told me about the ogres... 
 Ram | Don't tell it to Rem. 
 Ram | I'm certain she wouldn't like it. 
 Subaru Natsuki |" ""A scary witch, a terrifying witch. "
 Subaru Natsuki | To even speak her name was terrifying. 
 Subaru Natsuki | Everyone called her 
 Subaru Natsuki |" the Jealous Witch."" "
 Emilia | Are you sure about this? 
 Emilia |" We could call a royal car to
take you to the capital. "
 Subaru Natsuki | I'll be fine... 
 Subaru Natsuki |" One day, when I'm the kind of strong,
smart, rich man who's worthy of you, "
 Subaru Natsuki | I'll take you away on a white horse. 
 Emilia | Do you have a handkerchief? 
 Emilia | And water, lagumite ore, and... 
 Emilia | Will you be able to sleep by yourself? 
 Subaru Natsuki | Do you think you're my mom? 
 Roswaal L. Mathers | Then, Subaru-kun, be well. 
 Roswaal L. Mathers | And do not lose the gift I gave you. 
 Roswaal L. Mathers |" I added something equivalent to our three
days' worth of memories together... "
 Subaru Natsuki | Hush money, right? Don't worry, I get it. 
 Subaru Natsuki |" I won't say anything I shouldn't.
I swear to the dragon. "
 Roswaal L. Mathers |" Talking with you makes any evil scheme
seem to lose its purpose. "
 Roswaal L. Mathers |" And in this nation, swearing to the dragon
is the highest form of promise. "
 Roswaal L. Mathers | Be sure not to forget it. 
 Subaru Natsuki | Got it! 
 Subaru Natsuki | You two helped me out a ton. 
 Subaru Natsuki |" Especially you, Rem-rin.
Thanks for all the great food. "
 Subaru Natsuki | And Ram-chi... 
 Subaru Natsuki | Yeah! You're good at cleaning toilets, right? 
 Rem |" Sister, Sister... Our guest is
hopelessly bad at flattery. "
 Ram |" Rem, Rem... Our guest has a
fatal lack of skill in flattery. "
 Subaru Natsuki | Oh, shut up! 
 Subaru Natsuki | I seriously couldn't think of anything! 
 Subaru Natsuki | Thanks, though. 
 Rem | Yes, sir. 
 Ram | Yes, sir. 
 Emilia | Subaru! 
 Emilia | Thank you for everything. 
 Emilia | If you need anything, come visit anytime. 
 Subaru Natsuki | Sure! 
 Subaru Natsuki | Thanks, Emilia-tan! 
 Subaru Natsuki | Okay, this is it. 
 Subaru Natsuki |" From here, I can see Emilia's
room especially well. "
 Subaru Natsuki |" Now all that's left is to wait
for something to happen. "
 Subaru Natsuki | And stop it. 
 Subaru Natsuki |" She'd probably get mad at me
for using it this way... "
 Subaru Natsuki | I hope she does... 
 Subaru Natsuki | I don't want to die. 
 Subaru Natsuki | I don't want them to die. 
 Subaru Natsuki | What did I tell you, Natsuki Subaru? 
 Subaru Natsuki |" Even if no one remembers what
happens when things repeat, "
 Subaru Natsuki | you remember. 
 Subaru Natsuki |" Now that I think about it, I didn't
go shopping for Rem this time. "
 Subaru Natsuki |" Just because the food
meant for me was leftover? "
 Subaru Natsuki | It'll still be a while before dark. 
 Subaru Natsuki | Focus! Focus! 
 Subaru Natsuki | Emergency escape... 
 Subaru Natsuki | I saw it! 
 Subaru Natsuki | Yes, I saw it! 
 Subaru Natsuki | I saw where the sound of chains came from! 
 Subaru Natsuki | But is it coming this way now? 
 Subaru Natsuki |" Does this mean I played right
into the attacker's hands? "
 Subaru Natsuki | If you're coming, then come! 
 Subaru Natsuki | Do you have the nerve?! 
 Subaru Natsuki | All right... Show yourself, damn it! 
 Subaru Natsuki |" I've gone through all kinds
of hell to see your face! "
 Rem | Then I have no choice. 
 Rem |" The ideal scenario would have been to
finish this without anyone noticing. "
 Subaru Natsuki | You're joking... 
 Subaru Natsuki | Right, Rem? 
 EXTRA | The Sound of Chains 
 Rem |" If you do not resist, I can
make your death painless. "
 Subaru Natsuki | Why are you doing this? 
 Subaru Natsuki | That's a cliché, but do you mind my asking? 
 Rem | If someone seems suspicious, punish them. 
 Rem | This is the rule of maids. 
 Subaru Natsuki | Does Ram know? 
 Rem |" I intend to finish this before
my sister sees anything. "
 Subaru Natsuki | Is that how little you trusted me? 
 Rem | Yes. 
 Subaru Natsuki | Damn, I'm pathetic... 
 Subaru Natsuki | I was so sure we were getting along well. 
 Rem | My sister— 
 Subaru Natsuki | I don't wanna hear it! 
 Subaru Natsuki | Take this! 
 Subaru Natsuki | My leg! 
 Rem | Mana of water, heal this damaged body. 
 Rem | If you die so easily, 
 Rem | I cannot get any information from you. 
 Rem | If you had stabbed me with this, 
 Rem | you could have fled a bit farther. 
 Rem | I ask you this... 
 Rem |" Are you a member of the faction that supports
Emilia-sama's rival for the throne? "
 Subaru Natsuki | My heart belongs to Emilia-tan forever— 
 Rem | Who hired you, and under what conditions? 
 Subaru Natsuki | Emilia-tan's smile, and it was priceless— 
 Rem | Are you affiliated with the witch's cult? 
 Subaru Natsuki | The witch's cult? 
 Subaru Natsuki | I don't know what that is... 
 Subaru Natsuki | My family has been secular for generations— 
 Rem | Don't play dumb! 
 Rem | Your bald-faced lies can only take you so far, 
 Rem | when the witch's smell lies thickly upon you! 
 Rem | When I watched you conversing with my sister, 
 Rem | I felt I would go mad with anger and unrest. 
 Rem |" Someone associated with the one who
has caused my sister so much agony, "
 Rem |" boldly encroaching on the place
in which she and I belong... "
 Rem | I cannot bear it any longer. 
 Rem |" Even if I know my sister only acts friendly
with, and pretends to care for, you! "
 Subaru Natsuki |" I don't cut my hands when I
peel vegetables anymore. "
 Subaru Natsuki |" I can read and write now, even if
it's just the simple stuff. "
 Subaru Natsuki | I kept my word and studied. 
 Subaru Natsuki | I was able to read those fairy tales. 
 Subaru Natsuki | Thanks to you two... 
 Rem | What are you talking about? 
 Subaru Natsuki | I'm talking about the things you guys gave me. 
 Rem | I have no memory of any of that. 
 Subaru Natsuki | Why don't you remember?! 
 Subaru Natsuki | Why do you all keep leaving me behind? 
 Subaru Natsuki | What did I do to you? 
 Subaru Natsuki | What am I supposed to do? 
 Subaru Natsuki | What did I do wrong? 
 Subaru Natsuki | Why do you guys hate me so much? 
 Subaru Natsuki | Even when you said you'd cut my hair... 
 Subaru Natsuki | All that time, I... 
 Rem | I... 
 Subaru Natsuki | I really like both of y— 
 Rem | My sister is too kind. 
 Rem | Sir, have you awakened? 
 Ram | Sir, you're awake? 
 Emilia | Subaru, Ram and Rem were really worried. 
 Emilia |" They were unusually despondent,
wondering if they'd been impolite... "
 Subaru Natsuki | Nothing happened between them and me. 
 Emilia | Subaru, are you all right? 
 Emilia | If something's wrong, 
 Emilia | you're welcome to talk to me. 
 Subaru Natsuki |" If I could tell Emilia that it's no use,
that I can't take any more... "
 Subaru Natsuki | That's it. 
 Emilia | What? 
 Subaru Natsuki |" All this time, I've been struggling
to change things alone, but... "
 Emilia | Subaru, are you sure you're all right? 
 Subaru Natsuki | There's something I want you to know. 
 Emilia | Okay. 
 Subaru Natsuki | Emilia... Several times up till now, I've died. 
 Subaru Natsuki | Whoa... Wait. 
 Subaru Natsuki | This is seriously no joke... 
 Emilia | Subaru? 
 Emilia | Subaru! 
 Emilia | What happened, all of a sudden? 
 Subaru Natsuki | My body moves. 
 Subaru Natsuki | My voice works. 
 Subaru Natsuki | My heart doesn't hurt. 
 Subaru Natsuki | But... 
 Subaru Natsuki | The fear is engraved in me... 
 Emilia | What's wrong? 
 Emilia | You've been acting really strange. 
 Emilia | Subaru, if something's going on— 
 Subaru Natsuki | I have a favor to ask. 
 Emilia | Okay. 
 Subaru Natsuki | Have nothing to do with me. 
 Subaru Natsuki | I can't tell anyone about Return by Death. 
 Subaru Natsuki | I've died in this mansion three times. 
 Subaru Natsuki |" In the capital, I didn't
experience a fourth time. "
 Subaru Natsuki | If I die again, 
 Subaru Natsuki | I might not come back. 
 Beatrice |" That's quite a cowardly look
on your face, I suppose. "
 Subaru Natsuki | Why are you here? 
 Beatrice |" The brat and Bubby told me to
come and check on you. "
 Subaru Natsuki | Puck and Emilia? 
 Beatrice | Since you were acting strangely, 
 Beatrice |" they suspected I did something to you
when you first woke up, I suppose. "
 Beatrice | Talk about rude! 
 Subaru Natsuki | I get it. I'm okay now. 
 Subaru Natsuki | You came to apologize. 
 Subaru Natsuki | That's enough. 
 Beatrice | Why should I apologize to you, I suppose? 
 Beatrice | I can't leave until I correct that notion. 
 Beatrice | Not only do you look gloomy, 
 Beatrice | but the smell is much heavier now, too. 
 Subaru Natsuki | Huh? 
 Beatrice | The smell of the witch. 
 Beatrice | I feel it's bending my nose, I suppose. 
 Subaru Natsuki | Witch... You mean the Jealous Witch? 
 Beatrice |" What else in the world would someone
mean when they bring up a witch? "
 Subaru Natsuki | Why do you smell her on me? 
 Beatrice | Who knows? 
 Beatrice |" Regardless, as someone who receives
special treatment from her, "
 Beatrice | you're a burden. 
 Subaru Natsuki | It's not too comforting to hear 
 Subaru Natsuki |" I'm getting special treatment from someone
whose name and face I don't know. "
 Beatrice | If you have nothing to say, I'm leaving. 
 Beatrice | I'll tell Bubby what you told me, I suppose. 
 Subaru Natsuki | Wait a minute... 
 Subaru Natsuki |" You feel sorry for what
you did to me, right? "
 Beatrice | I do not. 
 Subaru Natsuki | I'm telling Puck! 
 Beatrice |" Well, I might feel just a
tiny bit sorry, I suppose. "
 Subaru Natsuki |" If you regret what you did and
want my forgiveness, "
 Subaru Natsuki | do me one favor that I ask. 
 Beatrice | Let's hear it. 
 Subaru Natsuki | On the fifth morning, 
 Subaru Natsuki | the day after tomorrow... 
 Subaru Natsuki | Would you keep me safe until then? 
 Beatrice |" I don't want you to bring dissension
into this mansion, I suppose. "
 Beatrice | This place is vitally important to me. 
 Subaru Natsuki | I have no intention of doing anything. 
 Subaru Natsuki | I just want to stop any sparks from flying. 
 Beatrice | What an admirable motive 
 Beatrice |" for one who leaves even that
in the hands of others. "
 Subaru Natsuki | For once, I have no response to that... 
 Beatrice | Hold out your hand. 
 Beatrice | I shall grant your wish. 
 Beatrice |" I, Beatrice, on my honor,
am henceforth bound by this contract. "
 Beatrice | Temporary or not, a contract is a contract. 
 Beatrice | I'll grant your nonsense favor. 
 Subaru Natsuki | Seriously? 
 Subaru Natsuki | I'm gonna cry because of a little girl... 
 Beatrice | Don't call me a little girl! 
 Beatrice |" And if you tell Bubby, you'll regret
it, I suppose! Hmph! "
 Subaru Natsuki | It's that important to you? 
 Subaru Natsuki |" That desperation of yours is
fanatical like a demon. "
 Subaru Natsuki | Stop! 
 Beatrice | You can't keep sleeping forever, I suppose. 
 Subaru Natsuki | Bombardier! 
 Beatrice |" I came against my will because
it's the designated time, "
 Beatrice | yet you seem awfully unconcerned. 
 Subaru Natsuki | Falling asleep on the fourth day, 
 Subaru Natsuki | what kind of reckless idiot am I? 
 Beatrice | Quit your grumbling, I suppose. 
 Beatrice | Just sit wherever you want. 
 Subaru Natsuki | The forbidden archive? 
 Subaru Natsuki | Did you carry me in here while I slept? 
 Beatrice |" I'd rather not stay in that room filled
with your stench, I suppose. "
 Beatrice | The forbidden library is the only place for me. 
 Beatrice | You need to observe proper manners, I suppose. 
 Subaru Natsuki | Beatrice, I'm sure I'm wrong, 
 Subaru Natsuki |" but you didn't hold my hand
while I was asleep, did you? "
 Beatrice | You're wrong, indeed. 
 Beatrice |" Even if Bubby asked me to,
I would refuse, I suppose. "
 Subaru Natsuki | Flat-out denial, huh? 
 Subaru Natsuki |" I'm not sure what you mean
by ""proper manners""... "
 Subaru Natsuki | So, hey, are you— 
 Beatrice | You're annoying me with all your questions! 
 Beatrice | Just be quiet, I suppose. 
 Beatrice | Calling. 
 Subaru Natsuki | Huh? 
 Beatrice | I've been summoned, I suppose. 
 Beatrice | Oh, right, you're here. I forgot, I suppose. 
 Subaru Natsuki | H-Hey, hold on! 
 Subaru Natsuki | If you go out there now... 
 Beatrice | I don't care if you want to stay here. 
 Beatrice | You'll be safe here, I suppose. 
 Subaru Natsuki | Damn it! What the hell is this? 
 Subaru Natsuki | Did I 
 Subaru Natsuki | make it through the fourth night? 
 Subaru Natsuki | And I thought it was so far away. 
 Subaru Natsuki | It was that easy... 
 Emilia | Subaru? 
 Subaru Natsuki | Emilia? 
 Emilia | Subaru, where have you been? 
 Subaru Natsuki | Oh, I was just... 
 Emilia | You know... 
 Emilia | No, never mind. 
 Emilia | Come with me. 
 Subaru Natsuki | Huh? Where are we going? 
 Subaru Natsuki | Emilia-tan? 
 Subaru Natsuki | Why are you making that face? 
 Subaru Natsuki | Everything will be fine now. 
 Subaru Natsuki | Right? I'm alive, and you're... 
 Subaru Natsuki | Oh, I know! Let's go to the village! 
 Subaru Natsuki | There's so much I want to do and tell you! 
 Subaru Natsuki | So much has happened! 
 Emilia | Subaru... 
 Subaru Natsuki | Emilia? 
 Subaru Natsuki | How... 
 Subaru Natsuki | Why is Rem dead? 
 Ram | Don't touch her! 
 Ram | Don't touch Rem... 
 Ram | Don't touch my little sister! 
 Roswaal L. Mathers | She died of weakness. 
 Roswaal L. Mathers | It was as if she merely fell asleep. 
 Roswaal L. Mathers | The method was more of a curse than a spell. 
 Subaru Natsuki | I thought it was Rem who used that curse. 
 Subaru Natsuki | So Rem isn't the shaman? 
 Roswaal L. Mathers |" My dear guest, have you any idea
what might have occurred? "
 Roswaal L. Mathers |" After this has happened to a dear
member of my staff, "
 Roswaal L. Mathers | I seem to be a little bit angry. 
 Emilia | Subaru, 
 Emilia | if you know anything, tell us. 
 Subaru Natsuki | I want to spill it all and get it off my chest. 
 Subaru Natsuki | Ow! 
 Ram | If you know something, spill it all! 
 Subaru Natsuki | Wait, Ram! That's... 
 Beatrice | I keep my promises. 
 Beatrice | As long as he remains in this mansion, 
 Beatrice | I am contracted to protect him, I suppose. 
 Ram | Beatrice-sama? 
 Roswaal L. Mathers |" Roswaal, he spent last night in the
forbidden library, I suppose. "
 Roswaal L. Mathers | So he surely had nothing to do with— 
 Roswaal L. Mathers |" There is no further need to emphasize
the situation at hand. "
 Roswaal L. Mathers | However, to guard him with your life, 
 Roswaal L. Mathers | you must have taken quite a liking to him. 
 Beatrice |" Save the jokes for your makeup
and weird fetishes, I suppose. "
 Ram | None of that even matters! 
 Ram | Get out of the way. 
 Ram | Let me through. 
 Ram | I must avenge Rem. 
 Ram | If you know anything, tell me. 
 Ram | Help me. 
 Ram | Help Rem! 
 Emilia | I'm sorry, Ram. Despite all this, 
 Emilia | I choose to trust Subaru. 
 Emilia | Subaru, please. 
 Emilia | If you can save Ram... If you can save Rem, 
 Emilia | please do. 
 Subaru Natsuki | I'm sorry. 
 Emilia | Subaru! 
 Ram | I'm going to kill you! 
 Subaru Natsuki | I ran. 
 Subaru Natsuki | I ran away. 
 Subaru Natsuki | I ran away from them. 
 Subaru Natsuki | I can't go back there again. 
 Subaru Natsuki | What choice did I have? What could I... 
 Subaru Natsuki | And I was 
 Subaru Natsuki | having so much fun! 
 Subaru Natsuki | This looks like the place where I died. 
 Subaru Natsuki | Where I died? 
 Subaru Natsuki | If I die... 
 Subaru Natsuki | Will I be saved from this whole situation? 
 Subaru Natsuki | Of course... If I die, everything will change. 
 Subaru Natsuki |" If I struggled and fought so much,
only to end up here, "
 Subaru Natsuki | then what's the point? 
 Subaru Natsuki | The cliff... 
 Subaru Natsuki |" If I close my eyes and take
one step, it'll all be over. "
 Subaru Natsuki | What will happen to me if I die again? 
 Subaru Natsuki | It's just one more step... 
 Subaru Natsuki | I can't even... 
 Subaru Natsuki | I can't even do something so simple. 
 Beatrice | I finally found you. 
 Subaru Natsuki | Why... 
 Beatrice | What, I suppose? 
 Subaru Natsuki | Why did you come for me? I... 
 Beatrice | The contract I entered into was to protect you. 
 Subaru Natsuki |" I thought you were only supposed to be
my bodyguard until this morning. "
 Beatrice | You must be mistaken, I suppose. 
 Beatrice | I don't remember discussing a time limit. 
 Beatrice |" Clinging to hope only serves your
own convenience, I suppose. "
 Beatrice | What was lost can't be reclaimed. 
 Beatrice |" You'll have no more chances to explain
yourself to the older sister. "
 Beatrice | You threw that away. 
 Beatrice |" No matter which is lost, those sisters won't
ever be complete again, I suppose. "
 Subaru Natsuki | But I cared about those two, 
 Subaru Natsuki | and I wanted to protect them! 
 Beatrice | What do you know about them, I suppose? 
 Beatrice |" No matter which is lost, they won't
be restored to what they were. "
 Beatrice | They can't be. 
 Subaru Natsuki | So in the end, 
 Subaru Natsuki |" I was just making a selfish, disgraceful
fuss, not knowing anything? "
 Beatrice | At the least, 
 Beatrice |" you need to die where I can't see you,
or I'll have bad dreams, I suppose. "
 Beatrice | So I'll help you escape this domain. 
 Subaru Natsuki | Come to think of it, back then, 
 Subaru Natsuki | someone was holding both my hands. 
 Subaru Natsuki | Ram... Rem... 
 Subaru Natsuki | If they couldn't bear to see me suffer, 
 Subaru Natsuki | and held both my hands... 
 Subaru Natsuki | If that was the kind of people they are, 
 Subaru Natsuki | how can I leave them? 
 Ram | I'm going to kill you! 
 Subaru Natsuki | I heard a voice filled with hatred. 
 Subaru Natsuki | But more than that... 
 Subaru Natsuki | Her cries won't leave my mind. 
 Subaru Natsuki |" I've always been the type to drift toward
whichever path was easiest. "
 Subaru Natsuki |" Hey, Subaru, you're thinking about
something pretty stupid. "
 Subaru Natsuki | And after I managed to save this life... 
 Subaru Natsuki | That's right. I saved my life, so... 
 Subaru Natsuki |" What's wrong with taking the path that's
easiest, that will let me live longer? "
 Subaru Natsuki | I'll decide how I use my life! 
 Beatrice | You were too slow. 
 Ram | I finally found you. 
 Ram | I won't let you get away. 
 Beatrice | Stay back, I suppose. 
 Beatrice | As long as my contract exists, 
 Beatrice | I won't hold back, not even against you. 
 Ram |" And you, Beatrice-sama, seem to forget
that we aren't in the mansion now. "
 Ram |" We're in the forest, away from
the forbidden library. "
 Ram | Are you certain you can protect him from me? 
 Subaru Natsuki | Boing! 
 Subaru Natsuki | Oh, yeah, that feels good! 
 Beatrice |" Wh-Wh-Wh-What are you doing?!
D-Do you want to die?! "
 Subaru Natsuki | Don't be dumb. 
 Subaru Natsuki | I don't want to die in the slightest. 
 Subaru Natsuki |" I'm fine with dying just once,
at the end of a long life. "
 Subaru Natsuki | That's how I really feel. 
 Ram | You have guts. 
 Ram | You finally accept your fate? 
 Subaru Natsuki | I wouldn't call it that. 
 Subaru Natsuki | If anything, 
 Subaru Natsuki | I'd say I've made up my mind. 
 Subaru Natsuki |" Sorry... I caused a lot of grief for
you guys by being such a loser. "
 Ram | You really do know something about Rem? 
 Subaru Natsuki | No, sorry, but I honestly don't know a thing. 
 Subaru Natsuki | Frankly, there's too much I don't know. 
 Subaru Natsuki | But... 
 Subaru Natsuki |" I decided to learn more about
the things I don't know. "
 Ram | How can you say that now? 
 Ram | Rem is already dead. 
 Ram | What can you do by learning anything now?! 
 Subaru Natsuki |" I won't make any cool statements
about what I'll be able to do. "
 Subaru Natsuki |" After all, this is what happened
when I couldn't do anything... "
 Subaru Natsuki |" I know better than anyone that my words
aren't convincing in the least. "
 Subaru Natsuki | But I do remember... 
 Subaru Natsuki | I know parts of you two that you've forgotten! 
 Ram | What do you know about Rem and me?! 
 Subaru Natsuki | You're right. 
 Subaru Natsuki | I don't know anything that's really important. 
 Subaru Natsuki | But you don't know, either, do you?! 
 Ram | Know what? 
 Subaru Natsuki | That I love you guys! 
 Beatrice | Wait! 
 Subaru Natsuki | This is something only I can do! 
 Ram | I'm going to kill you! 
 Subaru Natsuki | I'm going to save you! 
 EXTRA | Natsuki Subaru's start 
 Subaru Natsuki | I'm back here again... 
 Rem |" Sister, Sister... It appears our
guest is still half-asleep. "
 Ram | Rem, Rem... 
 Ram |" For one so young, it's quite
sad how out of it he is. "
 Rem | What is the matter, sir? 
 Rem | Do you feel unwell? 
 Ram | What's wrong, sir? 
 Ram | Do you have a chronic illness flaring up? 
 Subaru Natsuki | Let me see your hands. 
 Subaru Natsuki | So it's true... 
 Subaru Natsuki | I wasn't mistaken... 
 Rem |" No, sir. I think you are
mistaken about everything. "
 Ram |" No, sir. I think your
very birth was a mistake. "
 Subaru Natsuki |" When I think about what's to come,
I can't laugh off that comment. "
 Subaru Natsuki | But right now, even that's a good feeling. 
 Rem | Sister, Sister... 
 Rem |" Could our guest be a troubled man,
deriving pleasure from torture? "
 Ram | Rem, Rem, our guest appears to be 
 Ram | a pervert who's turned on by insults. 
 Subaru Natsuki | Sorry to do that out of the blue, 
 Subaru Natsuki | but I trust you both. 
 Subaru Natsuki | Let's be friends, okay? 
 Emilia | It was awfully noisy, so I came to check. 
 Emilia | Subaru, I'm glad you seem well. 
 Subaru Natsuki | A second ago, I had a lot on my mind, 
 Subaru Natsuki | but seeing you blew it all away, Emilia-tan! 
 Subaru Natsuki |" I guess you were the wonder
drug that my heart needed. "
 Emilia | Sorry, I have no idea what you're saying. 
 Emilia | But good morning. I'm glad you're well. 
 Subaru Natsuki | Yeah, good morning. 
 Subaru Natsuki | Okay, might as well get started... 
 Subaru Natsuki | Hire me to work in this mansion! 
 Subaru Natsuki | I must clear two broad conditions, 
 Subaru Natsuki | in order to survive a week in Roswaal's mansion. 
 Subaru Natsuki | First is to earn the trust of the staff here. 
 Subaru Natsuki | If I don't gain those girls' favor, 
 Subaru Natsuki | they're liable to kill me, to silence me. 
 Subaru Natsuki | That goes not only for Rem and Ram, 
 Subaru Natsuki | but for their master, Roswaal, as well. 
 Subaru Natsuki |" And second is to defeat the shaman
that attacks Roswaal's mansion! "
 Subaru Natsuki | I'm exhausted... 
 Puck | You're quite the hard worker. 
 Subaru Natsuki | I'm not done yet. 
 Subaru Natsuki | I need to prepare dinner and clean the rooms. 
 Subaru Natsuki | I'll get back to work after a little break. 
 Puck | It's only your first day, and you're so spirited. 
 Subaru Natsuki | Well... 
 Subaru Natsuki | Some important things are at stake here. 
 Subaru Natsuki |" By the way, what kind of magic
does Emilia-tan use? "
 Puck | Technically, Lia isn't really a magic-user. 
 Puck | That goes for her contract with me, too. 
 Puck | She uses spirit arts. 
 Subaru Natsuki |" So those who use magic and
spirit arts are different... "
 Puck | Magic-users cast magic with their own mana, 
 Puck |" but those who use spirit arts draw
from mana in the atmosphere. "
 Subaru Natsuki | And how are those two different, Sensei? 
 Puck | Basically, it depends on whether you use a gate. 
 Subaru Natsuki | A gate? 
 Puck | Mana passes through a gate within your body. 
 Puck |" Through the gate, you both draw
mana in and expel it out. "
 Subaru Natsuki | I see, so it's like a spigot for MP... 
 Puck | You should also have one, Subaru. 
 Subaru Natsuki |" R-Really? Does that mean
I can use magic, too? "
 Puck | Want me to figure out your attribute? 
 Puck |" Magic-users are divided into fire, water,
wind, and earth attributes... "
 Subaru Natsuki | Whoa, it's totally a magic sound effect! 
 Puck | I know what your attribute is. 
 Subaru Natsuki | Yes! I've been waiting for this! 
 Subaru Natsuki | Is it the burning fire of passion? 
 Subaru Natsuki | Or a relaxed, cool-guy water type? 
 Subaru Natsuki |" Or maybe a gentle wind,
blowing across the plain? "
 Subaru Natsuki | Or is it solid, reliable earth? 
 EXTRA | Shadow 
 Puck | Shadow. 
 Subaru Natsuki | All rejected?! 
 Emilia | Wow, shadow? That's very rare. 
 Subaru Natsuki | What is shadow, anyway? 
 Subaru Natsuki | Weren't there only four attributes? 
 Subaru Natsuki | This is a category error! 
 Puck | In addition to the four basic attributes, 
 Puck | there's also shadow and light. 
 Subaru Natsuki | Is it actually some amazing ability? 
 Subaru Natsuki |" Like a talent only seen once
in five thousand years? "
 Emilia | With shadow magic, 
 Emilia |" you can obstruct an opponent's
vision, block sound, "
 Emilia | slow movements, and things like that. 
 Subaru Natsuki | It's just debuffs? 
 Puck | An easy one would be something like Shamac. 
 Emilia | That's a blinding spell, right? 
 Puck | Want me to show you? 
 Emilia | Wait, Puck... 
 Puck | Shamac! 
 Puck | Okay, that's it. 
 Puck | What'd you think? That was Shamac. 
 Emilia | Are you all right? 
 Subaru Natsuki | I-I'm fine! 
 Subaru Natsuki |" It's not too flashy, but it
seems pretty effective! "
 Subaru Natsuki | So I can also use this Shamac, right? 
 Puck | Well, that depends on your training. 
 Puck | Want to try the beginner's course? 
 Subaru Natsuki | Please, Master! 
 Puck |" I'll act as a support, and use
the mana inside you, "
 Puck | so the magic will come from your own gate. 
 Puck |" Lia, on the off-chance that Subaru's magic
goes out of control and explodes, "
 Puck |" you should step away, so your
clothes don't get messy. "
 Subaru Natsuki | That only happens if I screw up really bad, right?! 
 Puck |" If you can make relaxed, lighthearted
comments like that, you'll be fine. "
 Puck |" Now, visualize the flow of
mana through your body. "
 Puck |" Then expel a part of it,
through your gate, out of your body. "
 Subaru Natsuki | Visualizing, I can do. 
 Subaru Natsuki | Fantasizing is what I do best. 
 Puck | Huh? That isn't good. The gate just— 
 Puck | Long story short, 
 Puck | your control over your gate isn't very good, 
 Puck | so you shouldn't try too hard. 
 Subaru Natsuki | You're the one who said I'd be fine. 
 Puck | Tee-hee! 
 Subaru Natsuki | That's not cute at all... 
 Puck |" Well, for better or worse, your gate
hasn't been well-used. "
 Puck |" That's why the mana inside ignored
the user's will, bursting out. "
 Subaru Natsuki | What am I, a soy sauce bottle with a loose cap? 
 Emilia | You shouldn't move. 
 Emilia | You used up all the mana in your body. 
 Emilia | Maybe you shouldn't work anymore today— 
 Subaru Natsuki | No! I have to! 
 Emilia | Don't try to overdo it! 
 Subaru Natsuki | This is exactly when I need to overdo it... 
 Subaru Natsuki | I can't waste a single day. 
 Emilia | You really are hopeless... 
 Subaru Natsuki | What— 
 Emilia | Chew. 
 Emilia | Chew and swallow it. Three... And go! 
 Subaru Natsuki | Wh-What was that? 
 Emilia | It's a bocco fruit. 
 Emilia | When you eat it, your mana activates, 
 Emilia | and your gate regains a little of its strength. 
 Subaru Natsuki | Sorry, I guess I've caused you some trouble. 
 Emilia | You don't understand, Subaru... 
 Emilia |" It's more satisfying to hear a single
""thank you"" than a lot of ""sorry""s. "
 Emilia | I did it because I wanted to help, 
 Emilia | not because I wanted an apology. 
 Emilia | Okay? 
 Roswaal L. Mathers | So, Ram, given what you've seen so far, 
 Roswaal L. Mathers | what do you think of him? 
 Ram |" In terms of abilities,
he's completely incompetent, "
 Ram |" but when it counts, he can be
excessively quick-witted. "
 Ram |" I believe it may be necessary to keep
an eye on him for a time. "
 Roswaal L. Mathers |" This is a problem we must
handle with utmost care. "
 Roswaal L. Mathers | Be sure to give the proper warnings, 
 Roswaal L. Mathers | so your sister does not act rashly... 
 Subaru Natsuki |" I guess that's about all I can
expect of the first day. "
 Subaru Natsuki |" I earned quite a bit of trust from
Ram and Rem, I think. "
 Subaru Natsuki | But the problem is that shaman's attack... 
 Subaru Natsuki | How do I fight that? 
 Beatrice | You want to know more about shamans? 
 Subaru Natsuki | Yeah, how do you avoid curses? 
 Beatrice | There isn't a way. 
 Subaru Natsuki | Huh? 
 Beatrice |" Once a curse is activated, there isn't
any way to undo it, I suppose. "
 Beatrice | Once it's activated, that's it. 
 Beatrice | That's what curses are. 
 Subaru Natsuki |" It's actually possible to nullify
instant death resistances? "
 Beatrice |" However, before they're activated,
curses are just simple spells, "
 Beatrice | so I can easily undo them. 
 Beatrice | The scent of the witch... 
 Subaru Natsuki | You know, Rem mentioned that, too. 
 Subaru Natsuki | Who is this witch? 
 Subaru Natsuki | Are witches related to shamans? 
 Beatrice |" In this world, the word ""witch""
only refers to one person. "
 Subaru Natsuki | The Jealous Witch? 
 Beatrice | Exactly. The Jealous Witch, Satella. 
 Beatrice |" Long ago, she devoured the six witches
who bore the names of the deadly sins, "
 Beatrice |" and drained half the world dry.
She's the worst of the worst, I suppose. "
 Beatrice | It's said that she was starved for love. 
 Beatrice |" It's said that she doesn't
understand human language. "
 Beatrice |" It's said that her body never
withers, weakens, or dies. "
 Beatrice |" It's said that, though she was sealed by the
powers of a dragon, a hero, and a sage, "
 Beatrice | they were unable to destroy her flesh. 
 Beatrice |" It's said that her body is that
of a half-elf with silver hair. "
 Emilia | I'm... 
 Emilia | Satella. 
 Subaru Natsuki |" What would it take to make someone
steal the Jealous Witch's name? "
 Subaru Natsuki |" Oh, I guess ""steal"" makes
the person sound bad... "
 Subaru Natsuki |" I should say to make someone ""borrow""
the Jealous Witch's name. "
 Beatrice |" Either way, they must have
no fear of death, I suppose. "
 Beatrice |" One who would steal her name can
be called nothing but insane. "
 Subaru Natsuki | I see... So that's why. 
 Beatrice | Huh? 
 Subaru Natsuki | If people just saw her as a crazy freak, 
 Subaru Natsuki |" she wouldn't have to be involved
in this royal selection mess... "
 Beatrice | What are you talking about, I suppose? 
 Subaru Natsuki | Nothing. 
 Subaru Natsuki | Good morning! 
 Subaru Natsuki | It's another sunny day, perfect for drying laundry! 
 Subaru Natsuki | Let's make this a happiness-filled day! 
 Subaru Natsuki | Now... Victory! 
 Subaru Natsuki | Victory! 
 Emilia | You're so energetic again this morning. 
 Subaru Natsuki |" Yep! Even as I'm ordered around and
disciplined by the maid sisters, "
 Subaru Natsuki | I'll enjoy my servant's life to the fullest again! 
 Subaru Natsuki | But when that lifestyle wears me out, 
 Subaru Natsuki | I'll come rest my head in your lap, 
 Subaru Natsuki | so save it for me, okay? 
 Subaru Natsuki |" When you wash your face like that,
you really do look like a cat! "
 Subaru Natsuki | So, do spirits get sleepy and stuff, too? 
 Subaru Natsuki | Do they oversleep? 
 Puck |" Don't you people get sleepy
when you're fatigued, too? "
 Puck |" When a spirits' mana, the source
of their energy, is depleted, "
 Puck | they experience something similar... 
 Subaru Natsuki | Did you two stay up all night or what? 
 Subaru Natsuki |" I bet you were up late talking
about who you like, right? "
 Subaru Natsuki | Let me in on the fun! 
 Subaru Natsuki | Eh? 
 Subaru Natsuki | Who I like? It's embarrassing to say, but— 
 Emilia |" The one I like is Puck, and the
one Puck likes is me. "
 Emilia | There. That conversation's over. 
 Subaru Natsuki | Your love is mutual?! Then where do I fit in? 
 Puck | Nowhere. 
 Puck | Lia's head-over-heels for my charms. 
 Puck | You aren't a bad guy, 
 Puck | but compared to me, you've got nothing... 
 Puck | You should give up on Lia and— 
 Emilia | Don't get carried away, you two. 
 Emilia | If you keep this up, I'll get mad! 
 Subaru Natsuki | Ow! Ow! You are mad! You are mad! 
 Puck | Ow! Ow! You are mad! You are mad! 
 Subaru Natsuki | Whoops! 
 Subaru Natsuki |" I should get going, or the maid
sisters will be angry. "
 Subaru Natsuki | Bye. 
 Puck | What's wrong? You don't look happy. 
 Emilia | I just feel... sort of uneasy. 
 Emilia | I can't really explain it... 
 Puck | Well, I can't blame you for being confused. 
 Puck | This has gotten to be a bit of a problem. 
 Subaru Natsuki |" Don't worry! Don't worry!
Forget about it! It's fine! "
 Emilia | A problem? 
 Subaru Natsuki | Relax! 
 Subaru Natsuki | I'll clean this up so fast, no one will get hurt! 
 Puck | Subaru's mind is really mixed up. 
 Puck | The inside and outside are all confused. 
 Rem | I think that is an admirable attitude, 
 Rem | but you were the one who knocked it over. 
 Rem | I shall fetch a replacement— 
 Subaru Natsuki | No, that's okay! 
 Subaru Natsuki | I'll take care of the vase and flowers! 
 Subaru Natsuki | You just do your own work, Senpai! 
 Puck |" If he keeps this up, he'll wear
himself out before long. "
 Subaru Natsuki | It feels great to finish a job, huh, Rem-rin? 
 Rem |" But it was work you created and
took care of on your own. "
 Rem | When did you learn where the vases are kept? 
 Ram | Did my sister... 
 Subaru Natsuki | Yeah, that's right! Your sister told me! 
 Subaru Natsuki |" Since she knows me, she said, ""You're
bound to break a vase eventually. "
 Subaru Natsuki |" I'll tell you where the extra vases
are, so you'll be prepared."" "
 Rem | Subaru-kun... 
 Subaru Natsuki |" Whoops! I forgot about some work
Ram-chi asked me to do! "
 Subaru Natsuki |" Would you excuse me for a bit?
I'll take care of it quick. "
 Subaru Natsuki | Later! I'll come find you soon! 
 Subaru Natsuki | I feel sick... 
 Subaru Natsuki |" Don't you think my knife technique has
come a long way in only a day? "
 Subaru Natsuki | I think my talent has awakened! 
 Subaru Natsuki | I feel sick. I feel sick. I feel sick! 
 Subaru Natsuki |" Rem-rin, check out my aptitude,
which enables such detailed crafting! "
 Subaru Natsuki |" A miracle must be residing
in my fingertips right now! "
 Subaru Natsuki | Illusion! 
 Subaru Natsuki |" I feel sick...I feel sick... I feel sick...
I feel sick... I feel sick... I feel sick... "
 Subaru Natsuki |" Honestly, Emilia-tan! Every time
we meet, you stir my heart! "
 Subaru Natsuki | You're such a sinful girl! You're guilty! 
 Subaru Natsuki | I should be better able to laugh. 
 Subaru Natsuki | I should be better able to make them laugh. 
 Subaru Natsuki | I can't fail this time... 
 Subaru Natsuki | I can't waste a single second. 
 Subaru Natsuki |" I must throw all my strength into my
work and produce results, or... "
 Subaru Natsuki |" Oh, Ram-chi! I wasn't slacking!
I'll finish all my work! "
 Subaru Natsuki |" You can just kick back in your room
and take a siesta while I— "
 Subaru Natsuki | Damn, I look so lame... 
 Subaru Natsuki | I don't have time to spend whining. 
 Subaru Natsuki | You idiot. 
 Emilia | Subaru... 
 Subaru Natsuki | Emilia-tan! 
 Emilia | Subaru, come with me. 
 Subaru Natsuki | Uh-oh! A personal request from Emilia-tan? 
 Subaru Natsuki | How joyous! How embarrassing! How rare! 
 Subaru Natsuki | Say anything! Tell me to do anything! 
 Subaru Natsuki |" For you, I'd dive into fire, water,
the loot house, anywhere! "
 Emilia | Subaru... 
 Subaru Natsuki |" Hey, come on! The Emilia-tan
I know would say... "
 Subaru Natsuki | Wait! Are you a fake? 
 Subaru Natsuki |" But could anyone else look so gorgeous
that I just want to hug her? "
 Emilia | All right. 
 Emilia | Subaru, come here. 
 Subaru Natsuki | Wha— 
 Emilia | Just come. 
 Emilia | Okay, sit here. 
 Subaru Natsuki | Can't I sit on the bed or a chair? Why the floor? 
 Emilia | Just sit! 
 Subaru Natsuki | Yes, ma'am! With pleasure! 
 Emilia | Just this once, all right? 
 Emilia | Your position is a little weird. 
 Emilia | And... It tickles. 
 Subaru Natsuki | You're letting me rest in your lap? 
 Emilia | Don't say it aloud! It's embarrassing! 
 Emilia | And no looking up here... 
 Emilia | Close your eyes. 
 Subaru Natsuki | You're adorable when you're embarrassed, but... 
 Subaru Natsuki | What's this about, anyway? 
 Subaru Natsuki |" When did I do something worthy
of this kind of reward? "
 Emilia |" You don't have to put on that
weird tough act now. "
 Emilia |" Didn't you tell me to lend you my
lap when you were exhausted? "
 Emilia | I can't do this all the time, but today is special. 
 Subaru Natsuki | Special? It's only my second day. 
 Subaru Natsuki |" If I'm already completely worn out,
what kind of weakling am I? "
 Emilia | It's plain to see that you're overwhelmed. 
 Emilia |" You won't tell me what's
really going on, will you? "
 Emilia | I can't imagine this will make things any easier, 
 Emilia | but this is all I can do. 
 Subaru Natsuki | Emilia-tan, come on, now... 
 Emilia | Are you tired? 
 Subaru Natsuki | I'm totally fine. 
 Emilia | Are you troubled? 
 Subaru Natsuki |" If you're this nice to me, I'm gonna
fall in love with you. "
 Subaru Natsuki | When you... I mean, like that... 
 Emilia | It's been rough, hasn't it? 
 Subaru Natsuki | It was rough... 
 Subaru Natsuki | It was so painful. 
 Subaru Natsuki | I was so scared. 
 Subaru Natsuki | I was so sad... 
 Subaru Natsuki | It hurt so much, I thought I'd die... 
 Emilia | Uh-huh. 
 Subaru Natsuki | I tried so hard. 
 Subaru Natsuki | I tried so hard! 
 Subaru Natsuki | I was so desperate... 
 Subaru Natsuki | So desperate to make everything right! 
 Subaru Natsuki | It's the truth. 
 Subaru Natsuki |" I've honestly never tried so
hard at anything in my life! "
 Emilia | Uh-huh, I know. 
 Subaru Natsuki | Because I loved this place... 
 Subaru Natsuki | Because it was so important to me! 
 Subaru Natsuki | I was so desperate to get it back... 
 Subaru Natsuki | I was scared... I was so scared! 
 Subaru Natsuki |" I didn't want those eyes looking
at me like that again... "
 Subaru Natsuki |" And I hated myself so much
for feeling that way! "
 Rem | Subaru-kun? 
 Emilia | Shh. 
 Rem | Is Subaru-kun just asleep? 
 Emilia | Yes. 
 Emilia | He looks like a child, doesn't he? 
 Rem |" It appears Subaru-kun cannot
do any more work today. "
 Emilia | Yes, he's done for today. 
 Emilia |" What a bad boy, taking a day off,
on just his second day of work. "
 Rem | When he feels better, you can punish him. 
 Rem | Seeing him like this, I almost don't want to. 
 Emilia | Yeah. 
 Rem |" I shall inform my sister that Subaru-kun
will be useless for today. "
 Emilia | Rem... 
 Emilia | Subaru is a good person. 
 Subaru Natsuki | Did I really just bawl all over the girl I love 
 Subaru Natsuki |" and fall asleep, with tears and
snot all over my face? "
 Subaru Natsuki |" What kind of shame play is that?!
I'm totally hopeless! "
 Beatrice |" You burst in here late at night,
and that's what you say, I suppose? "
 Subaru Natsuki | Don't say that, Beako... We're tight, aren't we? 
 Beatrice | What kind of relationship do you think we— 
 Beatrice | Wait, what did you just call me? 
 Subaru Natsuki |" Oh... ""Beako""? "
 Subaru Natsuki |" I think pet names are indispensable
in showing affection. "
 Subaru Natsuki | So I'm gonna call you Beako. 
 Subaru Natsuki |" That's the best proof of my
affection that I can give. "
 Beatrice |" What sort of obtrusive display
of goodwill is that? "
 Beatrice | That isn't just disgusting. It's revolting, hmph! 
 Subaru Natsuki | Don't be so cold, Beako! 
 Subaru Natsuki | The thing is... 
 Subaru Natsuki | I'm backed into a corner here. 
 Subaru Natsuki |" Honestly, I want your help with
the curses I asked about. "
 Beatrice |" I told you that, once activated,
curses can't be undone, I suppose. "
 Subaru Natsuki | Yeah, you did. 
 Subaru Natsuki |" But can you detect curses before
they're activated instead? "
 Beatrice |" I am capable of discovering curses
before they're activated. "
 Subaru Natsuki | How are curses placed? 
 Beatrice |" There is one rule of casting curses
that cannot be broken, I suppose. "
 Subaru Natsuki | A rule that can't be broken? 
 Beatrice | Physical contact with the curse's target. 
 Beatrice | That is the prerequisite. 
 Subaru Natsuki | Other than those in this mansion, 
 Subaru Natsuki |" I've only touched the villagers
at the base of the mountain. "
 Subaru Natsuki | I was cursed in the village, 
 Subaru Natsuki | it activated that night, in the mansion, 
 Subaru Natsuki | and then I died? 
 Subaru Natsuki |" That would explain why the shaman
got Rem last time. "
 Subaru Natsuki |" I didn't go to the village, so she
ended up being the target. "
 Subaru Natsuki | It fits... It all fits now! 
 Subaru Natsuki | I've finally found a lead, 
 Subaru Natsuki | damn it! 
 Beatrice |" Is that any attitude to take toward someone
you asked for help, I suppose? "
 Beatrice |" If it was helpful to you, I think
there's something you should say. "
 Subaru Natsuki | Yeah, that's right! 
 Subaru Natsuki |" You saved me! Thanks to you,
I can see the light! "
 Subaru Natsuki | Beako, I love you! 
 Beatrice | Let me— 
 Beatrice | Put me down, I suppose! 
 Subaru Natsuki | Dorowazu! 
 Subaru Natsuki | And so, a lot's happened, 
 Subaru Natsuki | but today is a fresh start! I'm a new me! 
 Rem | The lap pillow, right? 
 Ram | It was the lap pillow. 
 Subaru Natsuki | Huh? 
 Subaru Natsuki | Wait, you guys knew? 
 Emilia | Subaru, good morning. 
 Subaru Natsuki | Emilia-tan? 
 Emilia | Um, this is kind of embarrassing... 
 Emilia | Are you feeling okay? 
 Subaru Natsuki |" I wasn't so sure till I heard
your voice just now, but... "
 Subaru Natsuki | I'm okay now. 
 Subaru Natsuki | So, um, listen... 
 Subaru Natsuki | I'm sorr— 
 Subaru Natsuki | I mean, thanks for everything. 
 Emilia | You're welcome. 
 Rem |" Well, shall we start on this
morning's work, Subaru-kun? "
 Ram | We need to begin our morning duties. 
 Subaru Natsuki | Before that, I have a favor to ask. 
 Rem | A lap pillow, right? 
 Ram | It's a lap pillow. 
 Subaru Natsuki | I'm not that unscrupulous! 
 Subaru Natsuki | Actually, I want to go to the village. 
 Subaru Natsuki | It's not far, right? 
 Subaru Natsuki | Do we have any plans to shop for anything? 
 Rem | If I recall, we are low on seasonings, 
 Rem |" so I was thinking of going
to the village tomorrow. "
 Subaru Natsuki | Then why don't we go today instead? 
 Subaru Natsuki |" If we're running low, it never
hurts to restock sooner! "
 Ram | I don't see a problem with that. 
 Rem | Sister... 
 Ram |" You do need to go shopping, and we
have no urgent duties. "
 Ram | And you have Barusu to carry your packages. 
 Rem | If you say so, Sister. 
 Subaru Natsuki | All right! 
 Ram | But I'm going with you. 
 Ram | You'll have a pretty flower on each arm, Barusu. 
 Subaru Natsuki | Huh? 
 Subaru Natsuki |" Uh, I just hope those
flowers aren't poisonous... "
 EXTRA |" I Cried, My Lungs Out,
and Stopped Crying "
 Subaru Natsuki | And now for the final exercise! 
 Subaru Natsuki | Swing your arms out wide, 
 Subaru Natsuki |" then cross them in front of you
as you take slow, deep breaths. "
 Subaru Natsuki | In... And out... 
 Ram |" I came to check on you since
break time's almost over. "
 Subaru Natsuki | In... And out... 
 Rem | Things are quite lively. 
 Subaru Natsuki | Okay, finally... 
 Subaru Natsuki | Victory! 
 EXTRA | Victory! 
 Subaru Natsuki | All right! 
 EXTRA | Yeah! 
 EXTRA | I feel so much younger. 
 Subaru Natsuki | Okay, everyone has touched me now. 
 Ram | Barusu... 
 Ram | What sort of game is this? 
 Subaru Natsuki | Radio calisthenics. 
 Subaru Natsuki |" I think the fact that everyone,
young and old, can enjoy it "
 Subaru Natsuki | is the secret to its many long years of success! 
 Ram | Who cares? 
 EXTRA | Ram-chi, that was cold. 
 EXTRA | Ram-chi, that was mean. 
 EXTRA | Ram-chi, you're scary. 
 Ram | Did you teach these children to call me that? 
 Subaru Natsuki | Well, it was more like... 
 Subaru Natsuki | I wanted to spread some friendliness around? 
 Ram | I don't mind, but what about Rem? 
 EXTRA | Rem-rin? 
 EXTRA | Rem-rin? 
 EXTRA | Rem-rin-rin? 
 Ram |" And? Did you enjoy the village
trip you wanted so much? "
 Subaru Natsuki | Nothing to worry about there. 
 Subaru Natsuki |" When Muraosa patted my shoulder at
the end, my trip was complete. "
 Subaru Natsuki | What's up? 
 Subaru Natsuki | If you wanna say something, out with it. 
 EXTRA | U-Um... 
 EXTRA | Over there. 
 Ram | Have your way a bit longer. 
 Rem | If you say so, Sister. 
 Subaru Natsuki | All right! I owe you both, Senpai! 
 Subaru Natsuki | That's right, there was an event like this, too. 
 Subaru Natsuki | And this still happens? 
 EXTRA | She's usually so tame. 
 EXTRA | She only gets mad at Subaru. 
 EXTRA | What'd you do to her, Subaru? 
 Subaru Natsuki | That's what I'd like to know. 
 Subaru Natsuki |" If it's happened three times,
I guess we're just incompatible... "
 Subaru Natsuki | Oh, now's my chance! 
 Subaru Natsuki | If you'll excuse me... 
 Subaru Natsuki | There's the sensation I've longed to feel! 
 Subaru Natsuki | Nice! For a stray, this is great! 
 Subaru Natsuki | Hey, you have a bald spot on your head. 
 Subaru Natsuki | A scar? What did you walk int— 
 Subaru Natsuki | Yow! 
 Subaru Natsuki | You even bit me in nearly the same spot... 
 Subaru Natsuki | Are you a time traveler? 
 EXTRA | You got carried away! 
 EXTRA | It's what you get for touching her so much. 
 EXTRA | She is a girl, after all. 
 EXTRA | I don't think that's quite the problem here. 
 Subaru Natsuki | Also, no one's worried about me? 
 Subaru Natsuki | I'm gonna cry! 
 Subaru Natsuki | I made it... I made it! 
 Subaru Natsuki | Well done, me! Good job! 
 Subaru Natsuki | Seriously, good job! 
 Rem | Yes, yes, well done. 
 Ram | Yes, yes, good work. 
 Roswaal L. Mathers | Ah, I see the three of you are together. 
 Roswaal L. Mathers | That will save me some time. 
 Rem | Roswaal-sama. 
 Ram | Roswaal-sama. 
 Subaru Natsuki | Formal clothes? 
 Roswaal L. Mathers | Well spotted. 
 Roswaal L. Mathers |" I'm seeing someone who's a hassle
to deal with in normal attire, "
 Roswaal L. Mathers | so I had no choice but to wear dress clothes. 
 Rem | A visitor? 
 Ram | You're going out? 
 Roswaal L. Mathers | Ram is correct. I'm going out. 
 Roswaal L. Mathers |" I received a message that
was a tad troublesome... "
 Roswaal L. Mathers | So I'm off to make the rounds outside. 
 Roswaal L. Mathers | I do not expect to be home tonight. 
 Roswaal L. Mathers | So, Ram and Rem, take care of things. 
 Ram | Yes, sir. As you command. 
 Rem | Yes, sir. Even if it costs our lives. 
 Subaru Natsuki | Roswaal didn't leave the mansion before... 
 Roswaal L. Mathers | I'll also be counting on you, Subaru-kun. 
 Roswaal L. Mathers | Take good care of Emilia-sama. 
 Subaru Natsuki | Sure, you can definitely count on me for that! 
 Roswaal L. Mathers | Then, look after things while I'm away. 
 Subaru Natsuki | H-He can fly? 
 Subaru Natsuki | Magic is incredible... 
 Subaru Natsuki | The difference in circumstances 
 Subaru Natsuki |" must have been triggered
by my visit to the village. "
 Subaru Natsuki |" That means my strategy of acting
as a decoy is working as planned. "
 Subaru Natsuki |" And that's why I'm here for my
long-awaited Beako time! "
 Beatrice |" Your face looks quite different
than it did half a day ago. "
 Beatrice | You've been busy, I suppose. 
 Subaru Natsuki | I'd love to take it easy for a change, you know... 
 Subaru Natsuki |" But there's something I want
you to check out for me. "
 Subaru Natsuki |" I think I've been cursed.
Could you find out for sure? "
 Beatrice | What are you talking about? 
 Subaru Natsuki |" I think I've been cursed.
Could you find out for sure? "
 Beatrice | No one asked you to repeat yourself, I suppose! 
 Beatrice |" It's only been half a day since
I told you about shamans. "
 Beatrice | You're far too impressionabl— 
 Beatrice | Traces of a curse... 
 Beatrice | You really have been cursed, I suppose? 
 Subaru Natsuki |" So the shaman was one
of the villagers, after all. "
 Subaru Natsuki | Can you tell what kind of curse it is? 
 Beatrice | I can't say just from looking at the curse. 
 Beatrice | But as I told you, once it's activated, 
 Beatrice | chances are you'll die, I suppose. 
 Beatrice | You don't seem to be afraid of dying at all. 
 Subaru Natsuki | Huh? Are you nuts? 
 Subaru Natsuki | I'm insanely scared of dying! 
 Subaru Natsuki |" There's nothing in the world that
scares me more than dying. "
 Subaru Natsuki |" I wish people who say ""I'd rather die""
would actually die before they say it. "
 Subaru Natsuki | That's why, this time, I'll find a way out... 
 Subaru Natsuki | of this fate. 
 Subaru Natsuki | Okay, so get rid of this curse for me, would you? 
 Subaru Natsuki | I don't have much time. 
 Beatrice | Why should I have to save your life, I suppose? 
 Subaru Natsuki | I expected an unlovable response like that, 
 Subaru Natsuki | so I came prepared to convince you. 
 Subaru Natsuki | If I die, Puck is bound to be sad. 
 Beatrice | Huh? 
 Beatrice | Bubby wouldn't be all that disturbed if you died. 
 Subaru Natsuki | Oh, no... 
 Subaru Natsuki |" If I were to die, Emilia would
be at least a little shocked. "
 Subaru Natsuki |" When Emilia feels shock,
Puck takes damage, too. "
 Subaru Natsuki |" And if you could have stopped it,
but didn't, what would he think of you? "
 Beatrice |" I'll go along with your smooth
talk this time, I suppose! "
 Beatrice |" But after this, I'll have nothing
more to do with you again. "
 Subaru Natsuki | Sure. 
 Subaru Natsuki |" But when I'm in trouble,
I'll always come to ask for your help. "
 Beatrice |" I'll destroy the spell used in
the curse now, I suppose. "
 Beatrice |" The spell is burned into you on the
spot that the shaman touched, "
 Beatrice | so that's our reference. 
 Subaru Natsuki | I prepared for this. Don't worry. 
 Subaru Natsuki | The young men's leader with the crew cut... 
 Subaru Natsuki |" The old lady who felt so much younger
that she patted my butt... "
 Subaru Natsuki | And Muraosa, the fake village head. 
 Subaru Natsuki |" I made sure all the suspects
touched different parts of me. "
 Subaru Natsuki | A black mist? 
 Beatrice | How abhorrent, I suppose. 
 Beatrice | All done. You'll be fine now, I suppose. 
 Subaru Natsuki | So the place that the black mist came from 
 Subaru Natsuki | is where the shaman touched me, right? 
 Subaru Natsuki | Could that puppy actually be... 
 Subaru Natsuki | I have to get to the village. 
 Subaru Natsuki | They just keep messing with me! 
 Ram | The village? What for? 
 Subaru Natsuki |" Beatrice said the one who gave me this
wound is responsible for cursing me. "
 Subaru Natsuki | It was the dog that the kids were playing with! 
 Subaru Natsuki | That dog-looking thing cursed everyone it bit! 
 Subaru Natsuki | If I do nothing, they'll be in danger. 
 Subaru Natsuki | If you don't trust me, you can come along. 
 Subaru Natsuki | But we can't leave Emilia alone here. 
 Subaru Natsuki | Only one of you can come! 
 Rem | You're making up your own rules... 
 Rem | And if we are to obey Roswaal-sama's orders, 
 Rem |" there is no reason for either
of us to go with you. "
 Subaru Natsuki | No, there's not. 
 Subaru Natsuki | But was that the only order Roswaal gave me? 
 Ram | Very well, Barusu. 
 Ram | I'll allow you to act on your judgment. 
 Rem | Sister... 
 Ram | Rem will accompany you. 
 Subaru Natsuki | Just what I wanted to hear! 
 Ram | Rem, that's my decision, so please go. 
 Ram |" I'll confirm with Beatrice-sama
and protect Emilia-sama. "
 Ram | I'll keep an eye on that, too. 
 Rem | Sister, you shouldn't... 
 Emilia | Subaru, are you going somewhere? 
 Emilia |" I heard loud voices, so I came down
to see what was going on... "
 Emilia | What happened? 
 Subaru Natsuki | Something might be happening. 
 Subaru Natsuki | But you don't need to worry. 
 Emilia |" You look like you're going to do
something dangerous again! "
 Subaru Natsuki |" We were just wrapping up a dispute
on that particular topic. "
 Emilia | I can't stop you, can I? 
 Subaru Natsuki | I guess not, no. 
 Subaru Natsuki |" In fact, if you do, it'd be a
hindrance in several ways... "
 Emilia | Fine, fine, I get it. 
 Emilia | I won't stop you. 
 Emilia |" It's probably no use telling you not
to be rash or reckless, too, right? "
 Subaru Natsuki | Depending on what happens... 
 Subaru Natsuki | I mean, it's not like I want to do any of that. 
 Emilia | May the blessing of the spirits be with you. 
 Subaru Natsuki | Eh? Say what? 
 Emilia |" It's a prayer to send you off.
It means ""come back safely."" "
 Subaru Natsuki | Got it, Emilia-tan. 
 Subaru Natsuki | Okay, I'm off. 
 Emilia | Take care. 
 Rem | Has something happened? 
 EXTRA |" Y-Yeah... Several of the village
children have gone missing. "
 EXTRA | All the adults are looking for them. 
 Subaru Natsuki | Was I too late? 
 Subaru Natsuki | There! 
 Rem | Subaru-kun? 
 Rem | The barrier is broken. 
 Subaru Natsuki | What happens when the barrier's broken? 
 Rem | Mabeasts can cross the boundary. 
 Subaru Natsuki | Mabeasts? 
 Rem | Mabeasts are creatures of the witch's creation. 
 Rem |" They're enemies of humanity
that have magic powers. "
 Rem | They live gregariously in the forest. 
 Subaru Natsuki | Gregariously? 
 Subaru Natsuki |" You mean tons more dogs
like that one are out there? "
 Subaru Natsuki | The kids are in the forest. 
 Subaru Natsuki | Tell everyone! 
 EXTRA | Right! 
 Rem | Subaru-kun, what are you... 
 Subaru Natsuki | I have to go save those kids! 
 Rem | Wait! You can't make that decision on your own. 
 Rem | With Roswaal-sama away from home, 
 Rem |" can you be sure that this isn't a ruse to
divert attention from the mansion? "
 Subaru Natsuki | What do we do, then? 
 Subaru Natsuki | Ignore kids who are in trouble right now, 
 Subaru Natsuki | go back to the mansion, and tighten security? 
 Subaru Natsuki |" If you won't care when all the
villagers are dead tomorrow, "
 Subaru Natsuki | I guess that's an option. 
 Subaru Natsuki |" Rem, let's go. We're the only ones
who can do something about this. "
 Rem | Why go so far? 
 Rem | Why should this village matter to you? 
 Subaru Natsuki | You know, Petra... 
 Subaru Natsuki |" When she grows up, she wants to
make clothes in the capital. "
 Rem | Huh? 
 Subaru Natsuki |" Lucas wants to succeed the
village's best woodcutter. "
 Subaru Natsuki |" Mildo wants to make a crown
from the flowers in the fields, "
 Subaru Natsuki | and give it to his mother. 
 Subaru Natsuki | Meina is going to have a baby sister soon. 
 Subaru Natsuki |" And the brothers, Dyne and Cain, are
always fighting over who'll marry Petra. "
 Subaru Natsuki | They do matter to me. 
 Subaru Natsuki | I know their names, their faces, 
 Subaru Natsuki | and what they want to do in the future. 
 Subaru Natsuki |" And I promised them we'd do radio
calisthenics again tomorrow. "
 Subaru Natsuki |" I keep my promises, and I make
sure others keep theirs. "
 Subaru Natsuki |" I'm going to do radio calisthenics
with those kids again. "
 Subaru Natsuki | So I'm going in there. 
 Rem | Very well. 
 Rem | My orders were to keep an eye on you. 
 Subaru Natsuki | Yeah, that's right. 
 Subaru Natsuki | Make sure I don't do anything shady! 
 Rem | I will. 
 Subaru Natsuki | Um, Rem-san, is that... 
 Rem | It's for protection. 
 Subaru Natsuki | But that's... 
 Rem | It's for protection. 
 Rem | We're close. I smell something alive. 
 Subaru Natsuki | The kids? 
 Rem | I'm not sure, but it doesn't smell like animals. 
 Subaru Natsuki | It's the kids! 
 Subaru Natsuki | She's alive. 
 Subaru Natsuki | They're alive! 
 Rem | No, they're still breathing now, 
 Rem | but they are very weak. 
 Rem | If left alone... 
 Subaru Natsuki | Weak... The curse? 
 Subaru Natsuki | And we finally found them... 
 Subaru Natsuki | Rem, can't you undo it? 
 Rem | I lack the skill for this. 
 Rem | If only my sister were here to see them... 
 Rem | But I will cast a healing spell to comfort them. 
 Rem | When they're calm, we'll carry them back. 
 Subaru Natsuki | Okay, I'll... 
 Subaru Natsuki | Damn, I'm so useless. 
 Subaru Natsuki | I'll keep watch— 
 EXTRA | Subaru? 
 Subaru Natsuki | You're awake, Petra? 
 Subaru Natsuki | All right, good. You're a tough girl. 
 Subaru Natsuki | Don't overdo it, though. 
 Subaru Natsuki |" I'll take you back home, where you
can say goodbye to the pain. "
 Subaru Natsuki | Just rest for— 
 EXTRA | One is... 
 EXTRA | still... in the... 
 Subaru Natsuki | Hey, what'd you say? Petra! 
 Subaru Natsuki |" Damn it, she's right. I don't
see the little girl with the braid! "
 Rem | P-Please, wait! It's too dangerous. 
 Rem | And if the mabeasts took her, it's already... 
 Subaru Natsuki | I get what you're saying! I do! 
 Subaru Natsuki | But, Rem... 
 Subaru Natsuki | Petra says another girl was taken away. 
 Subaru Natsuki |" She showed concern for her friend
before asking for my help. "
 Subaru Natsuki | She put her friend before herself! 
 Subaru Natsuki | I want to respect Petra's feelings. 
 Subaru Natsuki |" If you take something on, you should
make the effort to take it all on. "
 Rem | If you get too greedy, 
 Rem |" you might take on more
than you can carry back. "
 Subaru Natsuki | That's why you're with me, isn't it? 
 Rem | What does that have to do with me? 
 Subaru Natsuki | Those kids need you now. 
 Subaru Natsuki | When the villagers show up, 
 Subaru Natsuki | leave the kids with them and follow me. 
 Rem |" We don't know the threat our opponent
presents, or when the villagers will arrive. "
 Rem |" And at worst, there is a chance
I won't be able to find you. "
 Subaru Natsuki | It'll be fine. You won't lose me. 
 Rem | What makes you so sure? 
 Subaru Natsuki |" Even if no one else does,
you can pick up my scent. "
 Subaru Natsuki | The foul odor that hangs on me... 
 Subaru Natsuki | The smell of the witch. 
 Subaru Natsuki | Right? 
 Rem | Subaru-kun, how much do you know about... 
 Subaru Natsuki | No idea... There's a ton I don't understand. 
 Subaru Natsuki |" So much that no matter how
many times I start over, "
 Subaru Natsuki | I can't find the answer I'm looking for. 
 Subaru Natsuki | Just like there are things you want to ask me, 
 Subaru Natsuki | there are tons of things I want to ask you. 
 Subaru Natsuki | So when this is all taken care of, let's talk. 
 Subaru Natsuki | Until our voices are hoarse! Promise? 
 Subaru Natsuki | I trust you, Rem. 
 Subaru Natsuki |" So I want to act in a way
that makes you trust me. "
 Subaru Natsuki | I'll make that promise right now! 
 Rem | Very well. The promise is made. 
 Rem | I will ask you many questions, so be ready. 
 Subaru Natsuki | Sure! 
 Rem |" Once the villagers come for
the kids, I'll come join you. "
 Rem | Don't do anything reckless. 
 Subaru Natsuki | Don't worry! I'm fanatical like a demon today! 
 Rem | Fanatical... like a demon? 
 Subaru Natsuki | It's the demon version of divine possession. 
 Subaru Natsuki | It's my favorite phrase lately! 
 Rem | Please be careful. 
 Subaru Natsuki |" If the one that cursed those kids
really was that dog from today, "
 Subaru Natsuki | there's no way I can lose, right? 
 Subaru Natsuki | I smell animals. 
 Subaru Natsuki | Is it a trap? 
 Subaru Natsuki | Emilia wouldn't hesitate! 
 Subaru Natsuki | Thank goodness... 
 Subaru Natsuki | This is not what we discussed! 
 Subaru Natsuki | Why is it so huge? 
 Subaru Natsuki | And was it waiting for me to come for her? 
 Subaru Natsuki | Nowhere to run... 
 Subaru Natsuki | Damn it! If you wanna fight, bring it on! 
 Subaru Natsuki | That... 
 Subaru Natsuki | doesn't hurt! 
 Subaru Natsuki | You just bit me, didn't you, you moron?! 
 Subaru Natsuki | I won... 
 Subaru Natsuki | You've gotta be kidding me... 
 Subaru Natsuki | If you wanna fight, bring it on! 
 Rem |" The children have been safely
returned to the village. "
 Rem | Thank you for buying time. 
 Subaru Natsuki | Rem, watch ou— 
 Rem | Shh. 
 Subaru Natsuki | Y-You're strong! 
 Rem |" I'm not sure if that's a nice thing
to say to a girl, Subaru-kun. "
 Subaru Natsuki | I have no other words to describe you! 
 Subaru Natsuki | You're seriously incredible! 
 Subaru Natsuki |" So, Rem, would you be able to take them
all out in one shot, by chance? "
 Rem |" We are outnumbered. With this
many, our situation is dire. "
 Subaru Natsuki | Yeah, I guess it would be. 
 Subaru Natsuki | In that case... There! 
 Rem | Now! 
 Subaru Natsuki | Rem, I don't know the way! 
 Rem | Straight ahead. 
 Rem | Once we cross the barrier, the battle will end. 
 Rem | Run toward the village bonfire! 
 Subaru Natsuki | Got it! 
 Subaru Natsuki | Rem, I see light! 
 Subaru Natsuki | We're almost to the barrier! 
 Subaru Natsuki | Rem? 
 Subaru Natsuki | Damn it... 
 Rem | Mabeast! Mabeast! Mabeast! Mabeast! 
 Rem | Witch! 
 Rem | Mabeast! Mabeast! Mabeast! Mabeast! 
 Subaru Natsuki | She's a demon... 
 Rem | Subaru-kun! 
 Rem | Don't die... 
 Rem | Don't die! Don't die! 
 Rem | Don't die! 
 Rem | ...to give up? 
 Rem | Is there no other way to save... 
 Beatrice | ...all, I suppose. 
 Beatrice | You can do as you like with him now. 
 Rem | I swear... 
 Rem | I'll save you. 
 Subaru Natsuki | Another unfamiliar ceiling. 
 Subaru Natsuki | Ow! 
 Subaru Natsuki | So they barely managed to save my life, 
 Subaru Natsuki | and these are the scars... 
 Subaru Natsuki | Emilia... 
 Subaru Natsuki | I guess now I owe her yet another debt. 
 Puck | I don't know about that. 
 Puck |" This time, you produced results
equal to the effort invested, "
 Puck | so I doubt Lia will think of it as a debt. 
 Subaru Natsuki | Puck... 
 Puck | Good morning, Subaru. 
 Subaru Natsuki |" You say these are results equal to my effort,
but I don't remember anything "
 Subaru Natsuki |" after I got nommed on by
those dogs in the forest. "
 Puck |" ""Nommed on""? That's a cute way to put it. "
 Puck | But it was actually... 
 Puck |" Munch, gobble, snarf, chew,
chomp, snap, crunch! "
 Puck | More like that. 
 Subaru Natsuki |" With all those sound effects,
I should definitely be dead now. "
 Subaru Natsuki | I think I'm five or six arms short for all that. 
 Puck |" Yeah, the blue-haired maid took
care of the rest of the damage. "
 Puck | She was in awful shape. 
 Puck |" Though she heals fast, thanks to
her demon transformation. "
 Puck |" By the time she carried you
back to the village, "
 Puck | she had no visible injuries. 
 Subaru Natsuki | Don't scare me for no reason... 
 Subaru Natsuki | Anyway, Rem went back to the village? 
 Subaru Natsuki | And what about the kids? 
 Subaru Natsuki | Was the curse removed? 
 Puck | No worries there. 
 Puck | Betty and I took care of it, so all's well! 
 Puck | Your judgment was right on the mark! 
 Puck | Clap, clap, clap. 
 Subaru Natsuki | Has Emilia been here all night? 
 Puck | Yeah. 
 Puck | To heal you, 
 Puck |" she drained her resources
right down to her odo, "
 Puck | so you should let her sleep. 
 Ram | Barusu, you're awake? 
 Subaru Natsuki | Ram... 
 Subaru Natsuki | Listen, uh... I mean, about Rem... 
 Ram | How shameful you are, 
 Ram |" pestering others for food so soon
after being that badly injured. "
 Ram |" Maybe some dog rubbed off
on you from the bites. "
 Subaru Natsuki | How the heck does some dog rub off? 
 Ram | Eat this. 
 Subaru Natsuki | Huh? 
 Subaru Natsuki | Sofubozu! 
 Ram | Delicious, isn't it? 
 Subaru Natsuki | I thought I was gonna die! 
 Subaru Natsuki | But yes, it was good! 
 Ram | It's freshly made. I mean... 
 Ram | Freshly steamed. 
 Subaru Natsuki | Why do you look so proud of yourself?! 
 Ram | Okay, okay. 
 Ram | You can have another, so be quiet and eat it. 
 Ram |" And well... As for last night,
you have my honest thanks. "
 Ram | Nice work. 
 Subaru Natsuki |" ""Nice work""? Always with
the condescending tone. "
 Subaru Natsuki | Was it something deserving of your thanks? 
 Ram |" When a domain's people suffer
any loss, its lord is held liable. "
 Ram |" If that pack of ulgarm had further
endangered those children... "
 Ram | You were right to do as you did. 
 Subaru Natsuki | Ulgarm? 
 Subaru Natsuki | That's what those black mabeasts are called? 
 Ram | Yes, but it's all right. 
 Ram | I reconnected the broken barrier, 
 Ram | so the village is safe. 
 Ram |" I kept an eye on the barrier overnight,
to ensure there were no problems. "
 Ram |" No ulgarm should be able to cross
it and enter the village. "
 Ram | So you can relax. 
 Subaru Natsuki | Beako... 
 Subaru Natsuki | Hey! 
 Subaru Natsuki |" I heard you helped remove
the curse from the kids. "
 Subaru Natsuki | Thanks. 
 Beatrice | No big deal. 
 Beatrice |" Betty only helped because
Bubby asked, I suppose. "
 Beatrice | I have something more important to discuss. 
 Subaru Natsuki |" What did you bring me all
the way out here to say? "
 Beatrice | In less than half a day, 
 Beatrice | you will die, I suppose. 
 Beatrice | You don't look as disturbed as I expected. 
 Beatrice | I thought you'd scream and cry, I suppose. 
 Subaru Natsuki | The curse still isn't lifted, then? 
 Beatrice |" When the pack of mabeasts
attacked you in the forest, "
 Beatrice | they planted another curse deep inside you. 
 Subaru Natsuki | Can I ask why this one can't be removed? 
 Beatrice | That's simple, I suppose. 
 Beatrice |" Too many curses have been placed on you,
making it too complex to remove. "
 Subaru Natsuki | Too many curses? 
 Beatrice |" When there's only one, removing it
is as simple as untying a knot. "
 Beatrice |" But the curses on you are a complex
web of many threads, "
 Beatrice | too tangled to undo. 
 Subaru Natsuki | Well, I get the idea that it's high in difficulty. 
 Subaru Natsuki | But why half a day? 
 Beatrice |" After half a day, mabeasts replenish
mana by activating their spells. "
 Beatrice |" The curse those mabeasts used drains
a target's mana, I suppose. "
 Beatrice | In other words, they made you mabeast food. 
 Subaru Natsuki | So they attack people because they're hungry? 
 Subaru Natsuki |" That's a wild animal for you.
So simple-minded! "
 Subaru Natsuki |" I guess we should be thankful they haven't
gotten hungry before now... "
 Beatrice | You... 
 Beatrice | You aren't even scared, I suppose? 
 Beatrice |" I'm telling you how much time
you have left, you know. "
 Subaru Natsuki | Well, sure, I'm scared. 
 Subaru Natsuki |" But I doubt you came here just
to tell me I'm going to die. "
 Subaru Natsuki | I don't think you're that mean. 
 Beatrice | What do you know about me, I suppose? 
 Subaru Natsuki |" If nothing else, I feel I've known you
four times longer than I really have. "
 Beatrice | You make no sense! 
 Beatrice |" But it's a fact that the chance for you
to be saved is much lower now. "
 Subaru Natsuki | Tell me... Just how low it is. 
 Beatrice |" We're talking about eating
by means of a spell. "
 Beatrice | If the one that's eating dies, 
 Beatrice |" logic says the meal would
be canceled, I suppose. "
 Subaru Natsuki | So that's it... 
 Subaru Natsuki | I just have to kill the things that cursed me. 
 Subaru Natsuki | But there are too many of them. 
 Beatrice |" That's why Bubby hasn't told
that silly girl about the curse. "
 Emilia |" Yeah, if Emilia knew, she'd definitely try
to do more than she's capable of... "
 Subaru Natsuki | Which makes me really happy, 
 Subaru Natsuki | but also really scared. 
 Subaru Natsuki |" Man, the difficulty level
is seriously demonic! "
 Subaru Natsuki | This is just plain impossible. 
 Subaru Natsuki | I might as well give up— 
 Rem | So you're going to give up? 
 Rem | Is there no other way to save him? 
 Beatrice | His head must be hurting, I suppose. 
 Beatrice | That isn't surprising. 
 Beatrice | That's all, I suppose. 
 Beatrice | You can do as you like with him now. 
 Rem | I swear... I'll save you. 
 Subaru Natsuki | It can't be. 
 Subaru Natsuki | Where... is Rem? 
 Subaru Natsuki | Beako... Beatrice, where is Rem?! 
 Beatrice |" In her position, what would
you do, I suppose? "
 Ram | I can't ignore what you just said. 
 Subaru Natsuki | Ram... 
 Ram | Beatrice-sama, 
 Ram | Rem didn't go to the forest alone, did she? 
 Rem | I... I have to do this alone. 
 Rem | No one else needs to get hurt anymore! 
 Subaru Natsuki | Why? 
 Subaru Natsuki | Why would Rem go to such lengths for me? 
 Subaru Natsuki | Hey, hold on! 
 Ram | Let go of me, Barusu! 
 Ram | Right now, I'm not calm enough to be kind! 
 Subaru Natsuki | If you want to save Rem, 
 Subaru Natsuki |" and if you consider me an
ally at all, listen to me! "
 Subaru Natsuki | Do you know where Rem is? 
 Ram | If I use my clairvoyance, I will! 
 Subaru Natsuki | Clairvoyance? 
 Ram | It's a power that allows me to see 
 Ram |" what the bugs and animals on
my wavelength are seeing. "
 Subaru Natsuki | Then they're like your security cameras? 
 Subaru Natsuki | Well, if we can use it to get to Rem, fine. 
 Subaru Natsuki | So, are you the kind of maid that fights? 
 Ram | What does that even mean? 
 Subaru Natsuki | It means I'm going to the forest with you. 
 Ram | You're going to follow me? 
 Subaru Natsuki |" Yeah. I'm bound to slow you
down in a fight, you know. "
 Ram |" If you expect that I can fight like Rem
does in her demon form, I can't. "
 Subaru Natsuki | You're twins, right? 
 Subaru Natsuki | If Rem is a demon, aren't you a demon, too? 
 Ram | Unlike Rem, I'm hornless. 
 Ram |" I can only use a rather extreme
bit of wind magic. "
 Beatrice | Going to retrieve the younger sister 
 Beatrice | would mean giving up on your own life. 
 Beatrice | You do understand that, I suppose? 
 Subaru Natsuki | That's not quite right. Let me correct you. 
 Subaru Natsuki |" Forming the habit of giving up because
you're used to dying is dumb. "
 Subaru Natsuki | Life is precious! You only get one! 
 Subaru Natsuki |" When you guys went through so much
to save mine, I realized that. "
 Subaru Natsuki |" So if you don't mind, I'm going
to struggle pathetically. "
 Subaru Natsuki | Let's go make a comeback! 
 Subaru Natsuki |" I've bounced back from the
terrible state I was in. "
 Subaru Natsuki | I'm a greedy guy. 
 Subaru Natsuki |" And I want to see this story's
continuation, with me in it. "
 Subaru Natsuki |" Now, let's get moving to
our last big showdown! "
 Subaru Natsuki | Bring it on, Fate-sama! 
 Ram | You gave a pretty heroic speech back there. 
 Ram |" But when I see you close to becoming
nothing but baggage, "
 Ram | it's difficult to hide my disappointment. 
 Subaru Natsuki |" I'm still recovering, so my energy
is spent, and I'm low on blood... "
 Subaru Natsuki |" Oh, and I didn't get to hear
Emilia-tan say, ""See you soon."" "
 Ram |" Until you say, ""I'm home,"" last night's
""See you soon"" is still in effect. "
 Subaru Natsuki | I-Is that how it works? 
 Ram |" Besides, didn't you get something from
someone other than Emilia-sama? "
 Subaru Natsuki | Yeah, something really awesome. 
 EXTRA | Take this. 
 EXTRA | It's the sharpest sword in the village. 
 Subaru Natsuki | Thanks, man. 
 EXTRA | We're counting on you. 
 EXTRA | Subaru! 
 EXTRA | Subaru! 
 Subaru Natsuki | Hey, you guys! You're awake? 
 EXTRA | Where are you going? 
 EXTRA | Back into the forest? 
 EXTRA | Don't go back there, Subaru! 
 Subaru Natsuki | I'll be fine. Don't worry. 
 Subaru Natsuki | I'm not going anywhere. 
 EXTRA | What's the sword for? 
 Subaru Natsuki | This? 
 EXTRA | It's a thank you gift from all of us. 
 EXTRA | I wanna thank you, too! 
 Subaru Natsuki | Hey! 
 EXTRA | You can have this! 
 EXTRA | And this! 
 Subaru Natsuki | Candy, a pretty stone... 
 Subaru Natsuki | And... 
 Subaru Natsuki | There was a freaking bug in it! 
 Subaru Natsuki |" Damn brats, sneaking that
in while I was distracted! "
 Subaru Natsuki | I'll lecture them later! 
 Ram | It's just proof that they admire you. 
 Ram | I wonder what they see in a man like you. 
 Subaru Natsuki | In a child's pure eyes, 
 Subaru Natsuki | my true, manly nature shines... 
 Subaru Natsuki | Also, I'm not the only one they like. 
 Subaru Natsuki | You could tell, right? 
 Ram | Yes... 
 EXTRA | Take this, too! 
 Subaru Natsuki | Hey! Why did you put dirt in there? 
 EXTRA | Just accept it! 
 EXTRA | Ram-chi! 
 EXTRA |" We also want to thank
Rem-rin, so bring her later! "
 EXTRA | Promise, Ram-chi! 
 Ram | Barusu, I'm going to use my clairvoyance. 
 Ram | Wait a moment. 
 Ram | Barusu, something is watching us right now. 
 Subaru Natsuki | What? 
 Ram | Up there. 
 Subaru Natsuki | Where? 
 Ram | More are coming. 
 Subaru Natsuki | Hey! D-Don't just walk off! 
 Ram | Anyway, why does every individual lose their head when they see you? 
 Ram | I don't understand. 
 Ram | Because you seem so weak? 
 Subaru Natsuki |" After all that hesitation,
that's your conclusion? "
 Subaru Natsuki | How rude! 
 Ram |" Then, perhaps it's because
you seem like a wimp. "
 Subaru Natsuki |" That doesn't change the root
of what you're saying, Onee-sama! "
 Subaru Natsuki |" Hey, can I ask what that ""hornless""
thing you mentioned means? "
 Ram | Nothing special. 
 Ram | Just as it sounds, 
 Ram |" it's another name for a foolish
demon that lost its horn. "
 Ram |" I got into a bit of trouble
and lost my only horn. "
 Ram | Ever since, I've relied on Rem for everything. 
 Subaru Natsuki | I guess I shouldn't have asked, huh? 
 Ram | Why? 
 Subaru Natsuki |" Well, I don't know how important horns
are to the race you call ""demons,"" "
 Subaru Natsuki | but I assume it's a pretty serious problem. 
 Subaru Natsuki |" I just thought asking about it
might have been insensitive. "
 Ram |" Back then was one thing. But now,
things have calmed down. "
 Ram |" By losing my horn, there are things
I've gained and lives I've saved. "
 Ram |" I'm sure Rem doesn't feel
the same way, though. "
 Subaru Natsuki | Huh? 
 Ram |" Originally, members of the
demon race had two horns, "
 Ram | but twins are born with just one horn each. 
 Ram | That's why twins are detested. 
 Ram |" And it's customary to dispose of
them immediately after birth. "
 Ram | But Rem and I were allowed to live. 
 Ram | A demon's horns awaken its demon instincts, 
 Ram |" allowing it to devour mana,
heightening combat ability. "
 Ram | But if one is reckless, 
 Ram | the recoil will leave one battered. 
 Ram | I don't want to see Rem like that. 
 Subaru Natsuki | Are you worried because you care for Rem? 
 Ram | Of course I am. 
 Ram | It's true that she is stronger than I am, 
 Ram | but that's no reason not to worry about her. 
 Ram |" No matter what we're told to do,
she does it far better. "
 Ram | But I am her older sister. 
 Ram | I won't waver from that position. 
 Subaru Natsuki | Okay, I get it. 
 Subaru Natsuki | I've got an idea. 
 Subaru Natsuki | So don't worry. 
 Subaru Natsuki | We'll bring Rem back safe! 
 Subaru Natsuki | If my idea is right, they're sure to come. 
 Subaru Natsuki |" They'll be drawn here by my attempt
to tell her about Return by Death. "
 Subaru Natsuki | Ram, the thing is, I can retur— 
 Ram | What's that? 
 Subaru Natsuki |" I made a wager that brought
a bit of pain with it. "
 Ram | What did you do, Barusu? 
 Ram |" The wind is erratic, and I
smell approaching beasts. "
 Ram | A lot of them... 
 Ram | And we haven't found Rem yet! 
 Subaru Natsuki | Well, don't worry. 
 Subaru Natsuki | I'm pretty sure we'll cross paths soon. 
 Ram | What makes you so sure? 
 Subaru Natsuki | Because of the witch's lingering scent! 
 Subaru Natsuki |" Rem's goal is to hunt down
all the mabeasts, right? "
 Subaru Natsuki |" The mabeasts will be drawn
to the witch's scent, "
 Subaru Natsuki | and come right to me. 
 Subaru Natsuki |" Then Rem will have no choice
but to follow them toward me. "
 Subaru Natsuki |" I call it ""Operation:
Natsuki Subaru is the Bait""! "
 Subaru Natsuki |" Okay, I'm gonna have to rely on
you to fight, so go for it... "
 Ram |" When this is over, look objectively
at what you just said "
 Ram | until you wish you were dead! 
 Subaru Natsuki |" This is what I get for believing you
when you said you could fight! "
 Ram | Well, I was fighting, wasn't I? 
 Ram |" My strength just didn't hold out
as long as I thought it would... "
 Subaru Natsuki | Damn it! 
 Subaru Natsuki | Crap! 
 Subaru Natsuki | D-Damn it all! 
 Subaru Natsuki | We were almost dead meat... 
 Ram | If we fall, we'll both be in trouble. 
 Ram | Barusu, can you climb up? 
 Subaru Natsuki | I'd like to make it up by sheer willpower, 
 Subaru Natsuki |" but the mabeasts waiting
there are a problem— "
 Subaru Natsuki | The sharpest sword! 
 Ram | El Fula! 
 Subaru Natsuki | That was close... 
 Subaru Natsuki | Seriously, Ram-sama had timing like Buddha... 
 Subaru Natsuki | Huh? Hey, Ram? 
 Subaru Natsuki | H-Hey! 
 Subaru Natsuki | Damn it. You can't be serious. 
 Subaru Natsuki | Shit, this timing couldn't be worse... 
 Subaru Natsuki | Rem! 
 Subaru Natsuki | Thank goodness you're alive! We're saved! 
 Subaru Natsuki | Damn it. 
 Subaru Natsuki |" She can turn into a demon,
but she can't control it? "
 Subaru Natsuki | Hey, Rem! My name is Natsuki Subaru! 
 Subaru Natsuki | A completely useless trainee in odd jobs... 
 Subaru Natsuki | The Roswaal mansion's most promising servant! 
 Subaru Natsuki | I've always caused trouble for you and Ram, 
 Subaru Natsuki | but we've been friends at times, 
 Subaru Natsuki | and we've fought at times— 
 Subaru Natsuki |" Trying to beat me to death while
I'm still talking is bad manners... "
 Subaru Natsuki | Now's my chance... 
 Subaru Natsuki | Damn, it's no use! I can't ignore her! 
 Subaru Natsuki | Take the plunge, Subaru. 
 Subaru Natsuki |" Men are about guts,
and women are about beauty! "
 Subaru Natsuki | So... 
 Subaru Natsuki |" Quit making that scary face,
and try to smile, Rem! "
 Subaru Natsuki | I can Return by— 
 Ram | Her horn... 
 Subaru Natsuki | You're awake? 
 Ram | That should have been the perfect moment. 
 Subaru Natsuki | You have good intuition, Onee-sama! 
 Subaru Natsuki | What about her horn? 
 Ram | It's the horn that's making Rem a demon. 
 Ram |" One good, solid hit should
bring her back to normal. "
 Subaru Natsuki | You're sure? 
 Ram | I am. I think. I hope. 
 Subaru Natsuki | That's vague! 
 Subaru Natsuki | A hit to that one spot. 
 Subaru Natsuki | Doesn't it seem impossible? 
 Ram |" Muster your wisdom and courage,
and do something. "
 Subaru Natsuki |" I actually do have an idea for
something we could do, "
 Subaru Natsuki | but it'll make you mad. 
 Ram |" If it'll bring my sister back to
her senses, I won't get mad. "
 Subaru Natsuki | Really? 
 Ram | Absolutely. 
 Subaru Natsuki | You swear to Ros-chi? 
 Ram |" That's the most reckless name
you could have chosen. "
 Ram | Yes, I swear to Roswaal-sama. 
 Subaru Natsuki | All right! 
 Subaru Natsuki | Heave... 
 Subaru Natsuki | Ho! 
 Subaru Natsuki | I freaked out! 
 Subaru Natsuki | I didn't have the guts for that last step! 
 Subaru Natsuki |" If I let this chance go by,
there won't be others! "
 Subaru Natsuki | Smile, Rem! 
 Subaru Natsuki | Today, I'm fanatical like a real demon! 
 EXTRA | Fanatical Like a Demon 
 Setanta | To us of the demon clan, twins are taboo. 
 Temae | Please wait, Chief! 
 Setanta | No! To protect our pride as a race, 
 Setanta | we must dispose of them. 
 Setanta | Such is the demon clan's custom! 
 Setanta | It is our law! 
 Setanta | This child is... 
 Setanta | She is a true prodigy. 
 EXTRA | Such power, with only one horn! 
 EXTRA | If she'd had two horns... 
 Quark | Very good, Ram... 
 Temae |" Rem, follow your sister's
example and work hard. "
 Quark | Don't worry. 
 Quark |" One day, Rem will show us that
she has incredible power. "
 Temae | You're right. She is Ram's sister, after all. 
 Quark | We expect great things. 
 Ram ( Child ) | Don't worry. 
 Rem  |" Sissy... 
"
 Ram ( Child ) | Just be you, Rem. 
 Ram ( Child ) | You don't have to worry about what people say. 
 Rem  |" I can never match my sister in demon power. 
"
 Rem  |" Then... 
"
 Rem  |" Hey, Mom... 
"
 Temae | What is it, Rem? 
 Rem  |" I'll make dinner tomorrow. 
"
 Ram ( Child ) | What are you making for dinner? 
 Rem  |" Hmm... 
"
 Rem  |" Maybe a stir-fry with barbaro rabbit
meat and nuts from the forest trees. 
"
 Rem  |" And steamed tatoes! 
"
 Ram ( Child ) | I'll help you. 
 Rem  |" No, I'll be fine by myself. 
"
 Rem  |" Just watch me. 
"
 Rem  |" Now, I just need a barbaro rabbit. 
"
 Rem  |" Sissy! 
"
 Temae | I'm just so glad you're both all right. 
 Rem  |" Both... 
"
 Quark | Rem, don't go into the forest alone again. 
 Temae | You don't want to worry your sister. 
 Rem  |" Yes, I'm sorry. 
"
 Ram ( Child ) | Wait, don't forget about this. 
 Ram ( Child ) | The steamed tatoes Rem made are really good. 
 Ram ( Child ) | They have just the right amount of salt. 
 Quark | You're right! They are good! 
 Temae |" I had no idea Rem could make
something so delicious! "
 Temae | That's enough, Rem. 
 Temae | I'm just happy both of you are all right. 
 Quark | Yes, we're so glad you're both safe. 
 Setanta |" No, it would have been better
if only Ram had been safe. "
 EXTRA | That's right. 
 EXTRA | You said it. 
 Temae | Yes, if only that useless Rem had died... 
 Quark | It would have been best if only Ram had lived. 
 Ram ( Child ) | You were having a scary dream, weren't you? 
 Ram ( Child ) | You were moaning. 
 Rem  |" Sissy... 
"
 Ram ( Child ) | It's all right. I'm with you. 
 Ram ( Child ) | So you don't have to worry about anything. 
 Rem  |" Right, Sissy. 
"
 Rem  |" I love you! 
"
 Rem  |" My sister really is amazing. 
"
 Rem  |" I can't match her in anything. 
"
 Rem  |" In that case, I don't have
to do anything anymore. 
"
 Rem  |" I can just walk behind her. 
"
 Rem  |" Sissy? 
"
 Rem  |" Sissy! 
"
 Ram ( Child ) | Rem... I'm glad you're safe. 
 Rem  |" It finally broke off. 
"
 Rem | Because of me, 
 Rem | my sister's horn was broken. 
 Rem | And she lost her power. 
 Rem |" From now on, I have to learn to
do all the things that Sissy... "
 Rem | That Sister could do. 
 Rem | This is what Sister would have done. 
 Rem | Sister is far more amazing. 
 Rem | Sister could do even more. 
 Rem | I only imitate what Sister could do. 
 Rem | If I cannot even do that satisfactorily, 
 Rem | I am worthless. 
 Roswaal L. Mathers | You're doing a fine job... 
 Rem | Many times, I heard those words back home. 
 Ram | Don't overdo it. 
 Rem |" Even if I overdo everything,
it will never be enough. "
 Frederica Baumann | Why do you try so hard? 
 Rem | Why else? Because nothing I do is enough. 
 Rem | Why should I go on living? 
 Rem | All of this is my atonement for 
 Rem | what I thought on that fiery night. 
 Rem | What can I do to atone? 
 Rem |" I shall risk my life to walk the path
that Sister would have walked, "
 Rem | the path I took from her. 
 Rem | Because I am inferior to her in every way. 
 Rem | I am nothing but a replacement. 
 Ram |" Barusu, head to the right of
that broken tree ahead! "
 Ram | You're too slow! 
 Subaru Natsuki | Don't ask any more of me... 
 Subaru Natsuki | I'm running... as fast as I can! 
 Rem | Subaru-kun... What... 
 Subaru Natsuki | You're awake, Rem? 
 Ram |" Thank goodness, Rem.
You really are a handful. "
 Ram | Fula! 
 Rem | Why... 
 Rem | Why didn't you just leave me alone? 
 Rem |" For you and Sister to show up
makes it all pointless. "
 Rem | I have to do it by myself. 
 Rem | No one else needs to get hurt anymore... 
 Subaru Natsuki | Too late for that. 
 Subaru Natsuki |" Ram and I are already torn to shreds,
maybe even more than you! "
 Subaru Natsuki | My right shoulder's dislocated! 
 Rem | It's... It's my fault. 
 Rem | So I have to take responsibility. 
 Rem |" If I don't, I cannot do anything
for Sister or you... "
 Rem | I haven't changed at all. 
 Rem |" I committed the same sin
as I did back then! "
 Rem |" Because I hesitated to
extend my hand to you... "
 Rem | The witch's scent? 
 Rem | You nearly died. 
 Subaru Natsuki | I'm not sure what you're talking about, 
 Subaru Natsuki |" but to atone for that, you got mad
and decided to do this alone? "
 Subaru Natsuki | Rem... 
 Rem | Yes? 
 Subaru Natsuki | Super slap! 
 Subaru Natsuki | For starters, are you dumb? 
 Subaru Natsuki | No, you are dumb! 
 Ram |" Barusu, the cut on your forehead
has reopened and is bleeding. "
 Subaru Natsuki | Yeah, I know I'm dumb, too! 
 Subaru Natsuki | But your sister is even dumber! 
 Subaru Natsuki |" Listen, where I'm from there's a saying,
""Three heads are better than one."" "
 Subaru Natsuki | Wait, is it two heads? 
 Subaru Natsuki | Whatever... The point is, 
 Subaru Natsuki |" three heads, thinking together,
are harder to break than only one arrow! "
 Subaru Natsuki | It means you should rely on 
 Subaru Natsuki |" those around you instead of
thinking about stuff alone! "
 Rem | Subaru-kun... 
 Subaru Natsuki | Damn... 
 Subaru Natsuki |" Ram, which way should we run
to get outside the barrier? "
 Ram |" We'd have to run left, at full
speed. What's your plan? "
 Subaru Natsuki |" I could shove Rem toward you and
run tragically to the right— "
 Ram | I'll draw the ulgarm's attention, 
 Ram | while you take Rem and run. 
 Subaru Natsuki |" Could you not expose my attempt at
hiding my embarrassment so easily?! "
 Rem | There's no way you will survive. 
 Rem | Please don't. If you do that, I will... 
 Subaru Natsuki | Don't worry. 
 Subaru Natsuki |" You don't know my brilliant plan
to round up all the mabeasts. "
 Rem | Subaru-kun, why would you do all this? 
 Subaru Natsuki | Well... 
 Subaru Natsuki | You were my partner for my very first date. 
 Subaru Natsuki | I wouldn't be so heartless as to desert you. 
 Subaru Natsuki | All right, guess I'd better go and do this. 
 Subaru Natsuki | Take care of Rem, Onee-sama! 
 Ram | I'll be praying for our safe reunion, Barusu. 
 Ram | Barusu's risking his life to buy us time. 
 Ram | Let's make the most of it. 
 Subaru Natsuki | I'd love to finish you off right about now... 
 Subaru Natsuki | I have an ace up my sleeve, too! 
 Subaru Natsuki | It's you and me, pal... Get ready! 
 Rem | Sister! Subaru-kun is... Subaru-kun is... 
 Ram | Don't look back, Rem. 
 Ram | Barusu's determination will be for nothing. 
 Rem | Sissy! 
 Rem | Subaru-kun! 
 Subaru Natsuki | Shamac! 
 Subaru Natsuki |" I could do without the bugs,
but I appreciate the bocco fruit! "
 Subaru Natsuki | Thanks for that, brats. 
 Subaru Natsuki | Crap— 
 Subaru Natsuki | You need to die! 
 Subaru Natsuki |" What's the matter?
Bring it on, boss garm! "
 Roswaal L. Mathers | Ulgoa! 
 Roswaal L. Mathers | Oh, my! You look an absolute fright! 
 Subaru Natsuki | You're way late, Ros-chi... 
 Subaru Natsuki |" But I'm surprised you
knew where to find me. "
 Roswaal L. Mathers |" In the village, Emilia-sama drove
it into me quite thoroughly... "
 Roswaal L. Mathers |" ""Even if it's rash or reckless,
he'll use magic if he's cornered, "
 Roswaal L. Mathers |" so don't lose sight of
him from above,"" she said. "
 Ram | Roswaal-sama! 
 Ram |" I am sorry to cause so
much trouble for you! "
 Roswaal L. Mathers | Oh, not at all. 
 Roswaal L. Mathers | In fact, you both did fine work in my absence. 
 Roswaal L. Mathers |" I shall most certainly show my
gratitude for your actions. "
 Roswaal L. Mathers | You have my word. 
 Subaru Natsuki | Subaru-kun! 
 Subaru Natsuki | Rem, that hurts! Stop! 
 Subaru Natsuki | I'm kinda hurt all over right now... 
 Rem | You're alive... You stayed alive... 
 Rem | Subaru-kun! Subaru-kun! Subaru-kun! 
 Subaru Natsuki | This... again... 
 Rem | Are you awake? 
 Subaru Natsuki |" Did I do this? Like, grabbed you
and never let go? "
 Rem | No, um... This is, well... 
 Rem | I did it. 
 Rem |" While you slept, you looked as
if you were in pain, so I... "
 Subaru Natsuki | You held my hand? 
 Rem |" At times like these,
I do not know what to do, "
 Rem |" so I did what would have made me
happiest, were I in your place. "
 Subaru Natsuki | Anyway, I'd like to hear the rest... I mean, 
 Subaru Natsuki | I'd like to know how it ended. 
 Subaru Natsuki | Were my curses removed? 
 Rem |" Yes. Roswaal-sama took
care of all the mabeasts. "
 Rem |" So there is no chance
the curses will activate. "
 Rem | I am sorry, Subaru-kun. 
 Subaru Natsuki | Hey... Come on, lift your head, Rem. 
 Subaru Natsuki | There's nothing wrong with me. 
 Subaru Natsuki | You always look calm, 
 Subaru Natsuki |" but you're not remotely calm
or collected, are you? "
 Rem | I do realize 
 Rem |" that I am a powerless and
incompetent demon clan dropout. "
 Rem |" So no matter what I do,
I can never match my sister. "
 Rem | I am merely her replacement, 
 Rem | and I have always been inferior. 
 Rem | Good for nothing. 
 Rem | Why was I the one to keep my horn? 
 Rem | Why could Sister not be the one to keep hers? 
 Rem | Why was she born with only one horn? 
 Rem | Why did... we have to be twins? 
 Rem |" I apologize. That was a strange
thing for me to say. "
 Rem | Please forget it. 
 Subaru Natsuki |" You know, Rem, you keep
putting Ram on a pedestal "
 Subaru Natsuki | and undermining yourself, 
 Subaru Natsuki | but if she were in your position, 
 Subaru Natsuki | I don't think she'd be any better off. 
 Subaru Natsuki | Ram is weaker than you, she can't cook, 
 Subaru Natsuki | slacks off on the job, says mean things. 
 Rem | Y-You're wrong! 
 Rem | Sister's true self is more... 
 Rem | If she had her horn, you would not say... 
 Subaru Natsuki | But Ram doesn't have her horn, 
 Subaru Natsuki | so I don't know that Ram. 
 Subaru Natsuki | I'm pretty sure you're the only one 
 Subaru Natsuki | who cares whether she has a horn or not. 
 Subaru Natsuki | What Ram doesn't have, you do. 
 Subaru Natsuki | Just accept that. 
 Subaru Natsuki | You're kind, hardworking, always do your best, 
 Subaru Natsuki | and your chest is bigger than hers! 
 Subaru Natsuki |" If you hadn't been around, those dogs
would've chewed me to death. "
 Subaru Natsuki | I was saved because you were there. 
 Subaru Natsuki | And as you can see, I'm alive! 
 Subaru Natsuki |" Not only because of your sister,
but because of you. "
 Rem | My true Sister could have done much more. 
 Subaru Natsuki | Maybe so. 
 Subaru Natsuki | But you were the one who was there for me. 
 Subaru Natsuki | I'm glad you were there... 
 Subaru Natsuki | Thank you. 
 Rem |" I... I told you that I am only
my sister's replacement. "
 Subaru Natsuki | Don't define yourself that way. It's too sad. 
 Subaru Natsuki |" Of course, I haven't heard the details
of how she lost her horn. "
 Subaru Natsuki | I won't ask, so I'll never know. 
 Subaru Natsuki |" And since I don't know, I get to
talk as if I know all about it. "
 Subaru Natsuki |" All you have to do is be the
horn Ram doesn't have. "
 Subaru Natsuki | You two can be a demon together. 
 Subaru Natsuki | Also, you call yourself a replacement, 
 Subaru Natsuki | but no one could replace you. 
 Rem | But... 
 Subaru Natsuki | Where I come from, there's a saying, 
 Subaru Natsuki |" ""Demons laugh when you talk about next year."" "
 Subaru Natsuki | So... 
 Subaru Natsuki | Laugh, Rem. 
 Subaru Natsuki | Take off that sad face, and laugh. 
 Subaru Natsuki | Laugh while we talk about the future! 
 Subaru Natsuki | While we talk, look forward to making up for 
 Subaru Natsuki | all the time you've wasted looking back! 
 Subaru Natsuki | We can start by talking about tomorrow. 
 Rem | Tomorrow? 
 Subaru Natsuki | Yep, tomorrow. 
 Subaru Natsuki | You can say anything, like... 
 Subaru Natsuki |" Whether you'll make a Japanese- or
Western-style breakfast tomorrow, "
 Subaru Natsuki |" or whether you'll put on your
right or left shoe first. "
 Subaru Natsuki | It can be something silly like that. 
 Subaru Natsuki | No matter how silly it is, 
 Subaru Natsuki |" you can talk about tomorrow
because you have a tomorrow. "
 Subaru Natsuki | How about it? 
 Rem | I am... very weak. 
 Rem | So I'm sure I will end up leaning on you. 
 Subaru Natsuki | What's wrong with that? 
 Subaru Natsuki | I'm weak, stupid, scary-looking, and dense. 
 Subaru Natsuki |" But I still live my life, expecting others
to take care of things for me... "
 Subaru Natsuki |" As we move forward, we can
lean on each other. "
 Subaru Natsuki |" Let's laugh and talk about tomorrow,
arms around each other's shoulders. "
 Subaru Natsuki |" It's always been my dream to talk
about next year with a demon "
 Subaru Natsuki | while we both laugh! 
 Rem | You are fanatical like a demon. 
 Subaru Natsuki | Right? 
 Roswaal L. Mathers | By the way, Ram, 
 Roswaal L. Mathers |" did you find the one who was
controlling the mabeasts? "
 Ram | Yes, but the trail has already vanished. 
 Ram |" It seems one of the children that
Barusu and Rem brought back "
 Ram | from the forest disappeared the next day. 
 Roswaal L. Mathers |" Is this going to be another
battle for the throne? "
 Roswaal L. Mathers | The Bowel Hunter, mabeast masters... 
 Roswaal L. Mathers |" We have involved ourselves with
some bizarre characters. "
 Ram |" No matter how many strange
characters you face, "
 Ram | you aren't the sort to lose heart, are you? 
 Roswaal L. Mathers | My, how audacious you have become. 
 Roswaal L. Mathers | Come here. 
 Roswaal L. Mathers | Now, shall we begin? 
 Roswaal L. Mathers |" I was unable to attend to you
for a whole night, after all. "
 Ram | I'm sorry. Please do. 
 Roswaal L. Mathers | You have used quite a lot of mana. 
 Roswaal L. Mathers | May the stars protect you. 
 Roswaal L. Mathers | I shall be busy again for a time. 
 Roswaal L. Mathers |" I know it will be hard on you,
but look after yourself and Rem... "
 Ram | As you wish. 
 Ram | Since that fiery night, 
 Ram | my body has belonged to you, Roswaal-sama. 
 Roswaal L. Mathers |" I must win this battle for the throne,
no matter what it takes. "
 Roswaal L. Mathers | For the sake of my goal. 
 Roswaal L. Mathers | For the coming day when I kill the dragon... 
 Emilia |" You're constantly getting hurt,
aren't you, Subaru? "
 Emilia |" You came to this mansion in the
first place because you were injured. "
 Emilia | Since then, it's only been four days. 
 Subaru Natsuki | It's not like I get hurt because I want to. 
 Subaru Natsuki | The world's just a little harsh on me... 
 Subaru Natsuki |" So you're welcome to spoil me rotten,
since no one else will, Emilia-tan! "
 Emilia | Don't joke around. 
 Emilia |" Puck kept trying to get me
to go after you guys, too. "
 Emilia |" Who knows what would've happened
if Roswaal hadn't made it back? "
 Emilia | Do you get it? 
 Emilia | Still, I suppose you saved me again. 
 Subaru Natsuki | Huh? 
 Emilia |" As thanks for saving me, I brought
you to the mansion, "
 Emilia | and now... 
 Emilia | Still, thank you so much! 
 Subaru Natsuki | Hey! It's fine, it's fine! 
 Subaru Natsuki | I only did it because I wanted to... 
 Emilia | I thought you'd say that, 
 Emilia | but it doesn't make me feel any better. 
 Emilia | I must do something to thank you... 
 Subaru Natsuki | Okay. Then, I'll take you up on that. 
 Subaru Natsuki | Go on a date with me, Emilia-tan! 
 Emilia |" A ""date""? "
 Subaru Natsuki | We'll go out together, see the same things, 
 Subaru Natsuki | eat the same things, do the same things, 
 Subaru Natsuki | and share the same memories. 
 Emilia | And that's all you want? 
 Subaru Natsuki | That's exactly what I want. 
 Subaru Natsuki | I want to show you off to the village kids, 
 Subaru Natsuki | and there's this awesome flower field! 
 Subaru Natsuki |" Even if all we do is stroll around,
it'd be a special occasion to me! "
 Emilia | All right. I'll go on a date with you! 
 Subaru Natsuki | Yes! That's why you're my EMF! 
 Subaru Natsuki |" Oh, ""EMF"" stands for ""Emilia-tan, major fairy""! "
 Subaru Natsuki | Okay, finally... 
 Subaru Natsuki | Victory! 
 EXTRA | Victory! 
 Subaru Natsuki | All right, line up! 
 EXTRA | Yay! 
 Subaru Natsuki | Time for your stamps! 
 Subaru Natsuki | Okay, who's first? 
 EXTRA | The kitty's so cute! 
 EXTRA | The kitty's awesome! 
 EXTRA | The kitty's so sad! 
 Emilia | The villagers seem to be full of life again. 
 Emilia | Thanks to you, Subaru. 
 Subaru Natsuki |" Well, I did put my life
on the line to save them... "
 Subaru Natsuki |" I went into the forest and
got bitten by dogs to save the kids, "
 Subaru Natsuki |" got bitten by dogs when I tried to save
Rem after she turned into a demon, "
 Subaru Natsuki | then had to be saved by Roswaal when I was about to be bitten by a giant dog... 
 Subaru Natsuki | Wait. 
 Subaru Natsuki | Did I even do anything at all? 
 Emilia |" Oh, come on! Don't fuss
over the small details! "
 Emilia | There are those who know the truth. 
 Emilia | That includes Roswaal and Ram. 
 Emilia | And especially Rem. 
 Emilia | And of course, 
 Emilia | I do, too. 
 Subaru Natsuki | A dragon-drawn carriage? 
 Wilhelm van Astrea | Welcome home. 
 Wilhelm van Astrea |" Please forgive me for parking
in front of your mansion. "
 Ram | An emissary is visiting from the capital. 
 Ram | Roswaal-sama is attending to them now. 
 Ram | Emilia-sama, please join him. 
 Emilia | An emissary? 
 Ram | I believe it concerns the royal selection. 
 Subaru Natsuki | All right... 
 Subaru Natsuki |" Given the circumstances,
I'll try not to do anything dumb. "
 Emilia | Um, I'm really sorry, Subaru, 
 Emilia | but this will be a very important discussion. 
 Subaru Natsuki | Aren't you bored waiting out here? 
 Wilhelm van Astrea | It tastes lovely. 
 Wilhelm van Astrea |" I feel as though I'm
indulging in a great luxury. "
 Subaru Natsuki |" It's actually the most expensive
tea in the mansion. "
 Subaru Natsuki |" If the pink-haired maid learns we drank
it without permission, she'll flip. "
 Wilhelm van Astrea | And what is it you hope to gain 
 Wilhelm van Astrea | from this old man, using such precious bait? 
 Subaru Natsuki |" I only want to know
the reason for this visit. "
 Subaru Natsuki | If you could just give me a vague idea... 
 Wilhelm van Astrea |" As I have no idea what your
standing is in this mansion, "
 Wilhelm van Astrea | I cannot say anything careless. 
 Wilhelm van Astrea | Please understand. 
 Wilhelm van Astrea |" However, I did see that you are
quite close to Emilia-sama. "
 Subaru Natsuki |" Did it look like things were serious
between Emilia-tan and me?! "
 Wilhelm van Astrea |" ""Tan""? "
 Wilhelm van Astrea | It is a steep path you climb. 
 Wilhelm van Astrea |" You are dealing with one who may
be Lugunica's future queen. "
 Subaru Natsuki |" Right now, we're just a super cute
girl and a useless servant boy. "
 Subaru Natsuki |" You probably think your wife is
the prettiest girl in the world. "
 Subaru Natsuki |" Isn't that what you thought
when you proposed to her? "
 Wilhelm van Astrea | My wife... 
 Wilhelm van Astrea | I understand. You are correct indeed. 
 Wilhelm van Astrea |" I believed my wife the most
beautiful lady in the world. "
 Felix Argyle | I'm back, Old Man Wil! 
 Felix Argyle | Sorry to make you wait outside. 
 Felix Argyle | I bet you were bored, huh? 
 Wilhelm van Astrea | Not at all. 
 Wilhelm van Astrea | This young man has been speaking with me. 
 Felix Argyle | Ah, nyow I see... Of course. 
 Felix Argyle | You must be the boy Emilia-sama mentioned. 
 Subaru Natsuki | Emilia did? 
 Felix Argyle | I guess you know nyothing at all, huh? 
 Felix Argyle | Let's go, Old Man Wil. 
 Felix Argyle | See you in the capital. 
 Emilia | Well, see, we aren't going for fun. 
 Emilia | I received an important summons— 
 Subaru Natsuki | If it's important, all the more reason! 
 Subaru Natsuki |" Aren't you in a battle for the
throne? I want to help you! "
 Subaru Natsuki | Please! 
 Rem |" It seems there are people in the
capital who helped Subaru-kun. "
 Rem |" This may be a good opportunity
for him to thank them. "
 Subaru Natsuki | Nice assist, Rem! 
 Subaru Natsuki | That's right! 
 Subaru Natsuki | Some people in the capital helped me. 
 Subaru Natsuki | I need to let them know I'm okay. 
 Roswaal L. Mathers | Why not? 
 Roswaal L. Mathers |" That can be kept separate from
our royal selection business. "
 Roswaal L. Mathers |" Subaru-kun should go to the
capital to thank everyone, "
 Roswaal L. Mathers | as well as to receive treatment. 
 Subaru Natsuki | Huh? Treatment? 
 Roswaal L. Mathers |" You overused your already-exhausted
gate in the mabeast battle... "
 Roswaal L. Mathers | Treatment would tend that wound. 
 Roswaal L. Mathers | You met the emissary earlier, did you not? 
 Subaru Natsuki | The cutesy-face with the cat ears? 
 Roswaal L. Mathers |" That was one of the capital's most
brilliant users of water magic, "
 Roswaal L. Mathers | as well as healing magic! 
 Roswaal L. Mathers | Felix is a peculiar character. 
 Roswaal L. Mathers |" Even Emilia-sama had difficulty
enlisting Felix's cooperation... "
 Emilia | Hey. 
 Subaru Natsuki | Really, Emilia-tan? 
 Subaru Natsuki | You did that for me? 
 Emilia |" W-Well, it's partly my fault that
you haven't healed yet... "
 Emilia | So you could say I'm repaying a debt. 
 Emilia | It's compensation equal to what you gave up! 
 Felix Argyle |" I was surprised to see you
talk with that boy. "
 Felix Argyle |" I thought you preferred chopping people
in half than talking to them. "
 Wilhelm van Astrea | That is a grave misunderstanding. 
 Wilhelm van Astrea |" I merely took a bit of a liking
to that young man's eyes. "
 Wilhelm van Astrea |" Those are the eyes of one who has
experienced death several times. "
 Felix Argyle | Hmm, you've lost me nyow . 
 Felix Argyle |" But if Wilhelm van Astrea,
the sword demon, says it, "
 Felix Argyle | I'm sure the boy faces quite a bumpy road. 
 Subaru Natsuki | You know, Emilia-tan... 
 Subaru Natsuki | Maybe we should stop this? 
 Emilia | Absolutely not! 
 Emilia | I know you. 
 Emilia |" The moment I look away, you'll be
doing something crazy. "
 Subaru Natsuki | Oh, man! I'm seriously moved! 
 Subaru Natsuki | I'm totally fantasying right now, baby! 
 Rem | Subaru-kun is cute. 
 Subaru Natsuki | Parallel worlds rul— 
 Emilia | Subaru! 
 Subaru Natsuki | I'm really sorry for that. 
 Subaru Natsuki | But this is treating me like a kid! 
 Emilia |" Even though you wanted to hold
hands on our date in the village? "
 Subaru Natsuki |" I was physically and
mentally prepared for that. "
 Subaru Natsuki | This time, I'm not! 
 Subaru Natsuki | My hand's sweating like crazy! 
 Kadomon Risch |" Would you two quit
it with the flirting already? "
 Kadomon Risch | You're gonna drive away my customers. 
 Subaru Natsuki | After I came to make good on my promise? 
 Subaru Natsuki | That's cold, man... 
 Kadomon Risch |" Well, I appreciate that
you felt obliged to shop, "
 Kadomon Risch | now that you're not broke anymore. 
 Kadomon Risch | Here are the appas I promised. 
 Subaru Natsuki | Next, it's Felt and Old Man Rom. 
 Emilia |" I thought we'd wrapped things up
without blame the first time. "
 Emilia | But then Reinhard's expression went dark, 
 Emilia | and he took the girl away. 
 Subaru Natsuki |" That makes it sound like kidnapping,
or an abduction and confinement. "
 Subaru Natsuki | Hot guys really have it good... 
 Emilia | If we want to contact Reinhard, 
 Emilia |" we should probably go to the guard station
in front of the district for the nobility. "
 Subaru Natsuki |" Emilia-tan, about the royal selection
that begins tomorrow... "
 Emilia | Subaru, 
 Emilia | what did I tell you? 
 Emilia |" I brought you here to fulfill your
promises and to get you healed. "
 Emilia | You don't have to worry about me. 
 Julius Euclius | Well, if it isn't Emilia-sama. 
 Julius Euclius | It's good to see you again. 
 Julius Euclius | Have you been well since we last met? 
 Emilia | Yes, everything is basically the same. 
 Emilia | You also seem well, Julius. 
 Julius Euclius |" The mere fact that you
remember me is an honor. "
 Julius Euclius |" You have only grown more
beautiful, Emilia-sama. "
 Emilia | Thank you. Forgive me for asking so abruptly. 
 Emilia |" But I have business here, and I'd like you
to act as my agent in the castle. "
 Julius Euclius | Does your business involve this young man? 
 Julius Euclius |" His character and attitude
poorly suit his attire. "
 Julius Euclius |" That's no way to act before
one you've just met. "
 Subaru Natsuki | Thanks for the warning! 
 Subaru Natsuki | I've got a warning for you, too. 
 Subaru Natsuki | You shouldn't eat curry udon in that suit. 
 Subaru Natsuki |" If the soup splatters, the stains
will really stand out. "
 Julius Euclius |" I don't know what ""curry udon"" is, "
 Julius Euclius | but I shall keep that in mind. 
 Julius Euclius |" Now, allow me to show you
to the conference mirrors. "
 Subaru Natsuki | Conference mirrors? 
 Emilia |" A metia that facilitates talking with someone,
using two mirrors facing one another. "
 Subaru Natsuki | Ah, mirrors... How very magical. 
 Emilia | Subaru, wait here. 
 Subaru Natsuki | Eh? 
 Emilia |" I don't think it would be a pleasant
experience for you. "
 Subaru Natsuki |" I've already had an experience
that wasn't pleasant. "
 Subaru Natsuki |" That bastard, licking all over your cute,
little hand, as if he owned it... "
 Emilia | I'll try to come back before things run too long. 
 Emilia | Be good and wait, okay? 
 Emilia | Please? 
 Subaru Natsuki | I look so pathetic. 
 Subaru Natsuki |" Doing that in front of the
guard station is bold. "
 Subaru Natsuki |" ""It's darkest at the
lighthouse's foot,"" I guess. "
 Ton | You little... 
 Chin | Don't screw around with us! 
 Kan | Want us to mess up that pretty face of yours? 
 Priscilla Barielle | Don't make such a racket, commoners. 
 Priscilla Barielle |" Fools with no character pick fights
for the most foolish of reasons... "
 Subaru Natsuki | Sorry I'm late, honey! 
 Subaru Natsuki | It appears there's been a bit of trouble. 
 Subaru Natsuki |" But remember who I am,
and cut me some slack. "
 Subaru Natsuki | Now, let's go. 
 Priscilla Barielle | Do not touch me as if you know me! 
 Subaru Natsuki | Cliffhanger... 
 Priscilla Barielle |" I don't want drooling commoners
to follow me around. "
 Subaru Natsuki | Recognize what's going on! 
 Subaru Natsuki |" It was supposed to be a classic scenario
where I save a girl from hoodlums! "
 Subaru Natsuki | Wait, no way. 
 Subaru Natsuki | Are you three the capital's only hoodlums? 
 Ton |" We met this guy in the alley
behind the shopping district. "
 Chin | It's the brat from back then? 
 Subaru Natsuki | So, for my sake, could you just let us— 
 Kan | Are you dumb? 
 Kan |" This just makes it three on two,
instead of three on one... "
 Priscilla Barielle | You should correct that. 
 Priscilla Barielle |" It isn't three on two,
but three on one on one. "
 Subaru Natsuki | Would you be quiet for a second?! 
 Subaru Natsuki | I have no choice. 
 Subaru Natsuki |" This is the last trick
I wanted to use, but... "
 Subaru Natsuki | I'm just telling you, I know Reinhard-san. 
 Subaru Natsuki | If I call for him, he'll come running! 
 Subaru Natsuki | Secret Technique: Fox in Tiger's Clothing. 
 Rom | Been a while since I've seen you. 
 Rom | What're ya doing here? 
 Subaru Natsuki | Old Man Rom! 
 Chin | Damn you! 
 Kan | Damn you! 
 Ton | Damn you! 
 Kan | We won't forget this! 
 Ton | We won't forget this! 
 Chin | We won't forget this! 
 Subaru Natsuki | You saved me, Old Man Rom... 
 Subaru Natsuki |" I doubt this girl and I
could've handled that alone. "
 Priscilla Barielle | Don't misunderstand. 
 Priscilla Barielle | Even without you two, I was in no trouble. 
 Subaru Natsuki | Say what? 
 Subaru Natsuki |" ""I didn't need your help. I'm super
strong! I was doing just fine!"" "
 Subaru Natsuki | Something like that? 
 Priscilla Barielle | No. 
 Priscilla Barielle |" This world is designed to operate in
the way that works best for me, "
 Priscilla Barielle | so I am never at a disadvantage. 
 Subaru Natsuki | R-Really? 
 Subaru Natsuki | Well, I shouldn't have butted in, then. 
 Subaru Natsuki | Sorry to interfere! 
 Rom | By the way, boy, 
 Rom | you know where Felt went off to? 
 Subaru Natsuki | You didn't hear? 
 Subaru Natsuki | Apparently, Reinhard took her away. 
 Rom | Reinhard... 
 Rom | It had to be an Astrea, eh? 
 Subaru Natsuki | Something wrong? 
 Rom | Nah, just talkin' to myself. 
 Rom |" You try not to cause
any more trouble, ya hear? "
 Subaru Natsuki | S-Sure. 
 Emilia | I finally found you! 
 Subaru Natsuki | Oh, Emili— 
 Subaru Natsuki | Wait, wait, wait! 
 Subaru Natsuki |" You can't just pick up Emilia-tan
while I'm away! "
 Aldebaran |" Seems your buddy's got a
screw loose, little lady. "
 Aldebaran |" More worried about losing you to
another man than happy to see you. "
 Aldebaran |" A man's heart is so complex,
it's a thrill to watch. "
 Subaru Natsuki |" You've got a pretty messed-up
fashion sense of your own! "
 Aldebaran | Now, that's no way to talk to someone... 
 Aldebaran |" As I'm a cool,
good-natured man, I'll overlook it. "
 Aldebaran | But some might lop off your head for that. 
 Emilia | Relax, Subaru. His outfit surprised me, too. 
 Aldebaran | Yeah, well... 
 Aldebaran |" I was surprised when she asked for my help
while I was looking for a lost child, too. "
 Emilia | Emilia-tan, you're too soft-hearted. 
 Emilia |" Most would think a guy dressed like this
was looking for a lost child to kidnap them. "
 Priscilla Barielle |" My, how attentive you are to wait
where you knew I would be. "
 Priscilla Barielle | I commend your dedication, Al. 
 Subaru Natsuki | You were the lost child? 
 Subaru Natsuki |" Well, it looks like we both found the
ones we were looking for. Let's go. "
 Priscilla Barielle | Wait. 
 Priscilla Barielle | What is in that bag? 
 Subaru Natsuki | They're appas. 
 Subaru Natsuki | You've never seen one? 
 Priscilla Barielle | Don't make me laugh. 
 Priscilla Barielle | Appas have white flesh. 
 Subaru Natsuki | Well, yeah, the insides are white... 
 Subaru Natsuki |" Wait, s-so you've never
seen an unpeeled appa? "
 Subaru Natsuki | For you. 
 Subaru Natsuki |" Don't skip off after
any bad guys again, okay? "
 Emilia | Subaru... 
 Emilia | That girl from before... 
 Subaru Natsuki | Huh? 
 Emilia | Where did you meet that girl? 
 Emilia | And how? 
 Subaru Natsuki | What's this, Emilia-tan? Are you jealous? 
 Subaru Natsuki | Are you actually getting jealous over me? 
 Emilia | Subaru... 
 Subaru Natsuki | H-Huh? Emilia-tan, why the serious face? 
 Emilia | N-Nothing... If you don't know, it's fine. 
 Emilia | Forget it. 
 Priscilla Barielle | Oh! It really is an appa! 
 Subaru Natsuki | Huh? I have to stay here tomorrow? 
 Emilia | Of course you do. 
 Emilia | That was our agreement all along. 
 Subaru Natsuki | Yeah, but we never reached Reinhard, right? 
 Subaru Natsuki |" So if we go to the castle tomorrow,
we might see him... "
 Emilia | I'll be sure to ask about Felt. 
 Subaru Natsuki | But I should go in person to— 
 Emilia | This is exactly why I can't take you with me. 
 Emilia | If I do, you'll push yourself too hard again. 
 Emilia | I don't want to let you do that. Understand? 
 Subaru Natsuki | You're the one who doesn't understand... 
 Subaru Natsuki | If I have to push myself to help you, I will. 
 Subaru Natsuki | I want to push myself! 
 Emilia | Absolutely not. 
 Emilia | Until your body fully heals, 
 Emilia | no using magic or pushing yourself! 
 Emilia | Promise me, Subaru. 
 Subaru Natsuki | All right. I promise. 
 Subaru Natsuki | I won't use magic... 
 Subaru Natsuki | So let me go with you! 
 Emilia | I can't bring an outsider into this. 
 Emilia | So please wait here with Rem, all right? 
 Emilia | I'm asking you, Subaru... 
 Emilia | Give me reason to trust you. 
 Subaru Natsuki |" I know there are those in the capital
who consider Emilia an enemy. "
 Subaru Natsuki | That's why I have to stay close to her. 
 Rem | What's the matter? 
 Subaru Natsuki | I'm going to save Emilia. 
 Subaru Natsuki | And to do that... 
 Subaru Natsuki | Stare... 
 Rem | Wh-What is it, Subaru-kun? 
 Rem |" When you stare with such dramatic
eyes, it makes me uncomfortable. "
 Subaru Natsuki | Stare... 
 Rem | It's at the castle. 
 Rem | There will likely be heavy security, though. 
 Subaru Natsuki | Security isn't the problem. 
 Subaru Natsuki |" I can't stand not being involved
in Emilia's important affairs. "
 Rem | Subaru-kun... 
 Subaru Natsuki | I'm only of any use when something happens. 
 Subaru Natsuki |" So I want to be with her when
important things are going on! "
 Rem |" Now, I shall set about preparing a new
appa recipe I just thought up. "
 Rem | It will require intense concentration, 
 Rem | so if one were to leave his room, 
 Rem | I likely would not notice. 
 Subaru Natsuki |" I'm such a scumbag for relying
on Rem all the time... "
 Subaru Natsuki |" But the problem is how I'm
gonna get into the castle. "
 Subaru Natsuki | I guess times like this call for that... 
 Subaru Natsuki | Hitchhiking! 
 Aldebaran |" You sure are lucky... Be grateful
for this coincidence. "
 Aldebaran |" We just happened to be on our
way to the castle, too. "
 Subaru Natsuki | The castle? What for? 
 Priscilla Barielle |" There is only one reason to
head to the castle today. "
 Aldebaran | Oh, you didn't know? 
 Aldebaran | This young lady here 
 Aldebaran |" is one of the candidates to succeed
to the throne of Lugunica, "
 Aldebaran | Priscilla Barielle-sama herself. 
 Subaru Natsuki | For real? Then why did you pick me up? 
 Priscilla Barielle | For no other reason than it seemed amusing. 
 Priscilla Barielle | A mere lark. 
 Priscilla Barielle |" Taking you to the castle will
make things interesting. "
 Subaru Natsuki | Interesting? 
 Priscilla Barielle |" This world is designed to operate in
the way that works best for me, "
 Priscilla Barielle |" so it's a given that all
things work in my favor. "
 Priscilla Barielle |" It is only a matter of choosing whether
something amuses me or not. "
 Priscilla Barielle |" However, if I had to name a reason
other than amusement... "
 Marcos | Your appa handler? 
 Priscilla Barielle | Indeed. He is something of a wretched clown, 
 Priscilla Barielle |" whose sole priority is to bring
me bittersweet red appas. "
 Marcos | Everyone is waiting inside. 
 Marcos | Make haste, please. 
 Priscilla Barielle |" As their superior, it is my privilege
to keep the masses waiting. "
 Emilia | Subaru? 
 Subaru Natsuki | Um... Emilia, I... 
 Priscilla Barielle |" Is there a reason you stare at
my manservant, half-wit? "
 Subaru Natsuki |" Get off! You'll give
Emilia-tan the wrong idea! "
 Roswaal L. Mathers | My, how nice to see you, Priscilla-sama! 
 Roswaal L. Mathers | Do forgive my servant for troubling you so. 
 Emilia | Why are you here, Subaru? 
 Emilia | Didn't I tell you to be good and wait for me? 
 Emilia | Don't you remember? 
 Marcos | The council of wise men will now enter. 
 Subaru Natsuki | The wise men... 
 Subaru Natsuki |" They're the people managing the country
in the king's absence, right? "
 Aldebaran | Hey. That's where we're supposed to stand. 
 Subaru Natsuki | I can stand there, too? 
 Roswaal L. Mathers | Well, now... 
 Roswaal L. Mathers |" It sounds entertaining, so you
may accompany him. "
 Emilia | Wait, Roswaal! 
 Emilia | If Subaru is allowed to stay, he'll— 
 Roswaal L. Mathers | Emilia-sama, the conference is beginning. 
 Roswaal L. Mathers | To the center. 
 Emilia | You'll explain this to me later! 
 Subaru Natsuki |" Then, those are the participants
in the royal selection. "
 Subaru Natsuki | The candidates for the future ruler? 
 Reinhard van Astrea | You came, after all, Subaru. 
 Reinhard van Astrea | When I heard Emilia-sama would be here, 
 Reinhard van Astrea | I suspected you'd be here, as well. 
 Subaru Natsuki | Reinhard, I've been looking for you! 
 Felix Argyle | Hiya, Subaru-kyun ! 
 Subaru Natsuki | You... 
 Reinhard van Astrea | Oh, Subaru, you know him? 
 Subaru Natsuki |" Huh? ""Him""? "
 Reinhard van Astrea | Yes. He is a knight, Felix Argyle. 
 Reinhard van Astrea | Despite appearances, he is male. 
 Subaru Natsuki |" If you're a guy, what's the point in having
those looks and even cat ears? "
 Felix Argyle | I don't know what to say. 
 Felix Argyle |" You're the one who made the wrong
assumption, Subaru-kyun ! "
 Reinhard van Astrea | Subaru, what's the matter? 
 Subaru Natsuki |" Where I'm from, this is the expression you
make when seeing a romantic rival! "
 Marcos | Now, if I may be so forward, 
 Marcos | I, Marcos, leader of the Imperial Knights, 
 Marcos | will direct today's proceedings. 
 Marcos | It all happened about half a year ago, 
 Marcos |" when members of the royal family,
starting with the king, "
 Marcos | went into hiding, one by one, causing— 
 Anastasia Hoshin | Listen... 
 Anastasia Hoshin |" I get that you wanna talk up a good
show here, but I'm busy, you know. "
 Anastasia Hoshin |" As we say in Kararagi, ""Time is money."" "
 Subaru Natsuki | Wait, the Kansai dialect? Are you kidding me? 
 Anastasia Hoshin | then why did y'all even gather us? 
 Crusch Karsten | I agree. 
 Marcos |" Crusch-sama, should the Karsten family
head say something like that? "
 Crusch Karsten |" Observing formality is important,
but it is also a fact "
 Crusch Karsten | that our time is limited. 
 Crusch Karsten |" It would be wise to inform us
why we are here at once. "
 Crusch Karsten | Naturally, I do have a general idea. 
 Miklotov | You already know the purpose of this meeting? 
 Crusch Karsten | Yes, Lord Miklotov. 
 Crusch Karsten | For a drinking party, correct? 
 Crusch Karsten | One day, we will face each other as rivals. 
 Crusch Karsten | But by sharing the same table and drinks, 
 Crusch Karsten | we will learn about one another. 
 Miklotov | No, that is not correct. 
 Crusch Karsten | Felis, this isn't what you told me. 
 Felix Argyle | Oh, come on... 
 Felix Argyle |" All I said was,
""Maybe it'll be a drinking party."" "
 Crusch Karsten | I see. I jumped to conclusions. 
 Crusch Karsten |" Forgive me. Allow me to
retract what I just said. "
 Anastasia Hoshin | Hey, now! 
 Anastasia Hoshin |" Even if she backs down,
my opinion isn't gonna change. "
 Anastasia Hoshin | No need to explain the royal selection now. 
 Anastasia Hoshin | We already know. 
 Anastasia Hoshin | Right? 
 Emilia | I think we should hear the— 
 Anastasia Hoshin | Sorry, but I wasn't askin' your opinion. 
 Subaru Natsuki | Why, you— 
 Aldebaran | Hey! 
 Aldebaran |" I don't know what's up with the selection,
so I'd kinda like to hear the rest. "
 Miklotov |" Priscilla-sama, I'm told
this man is your knight. "
 Miklotov | Have you explained the selection to him? 
 Priscilla Barielle |" Either way, you men will
ramble on about it, yes? "
 Priscilla Barielle | Continue, Marcos. 
 Marcos | Then... 
 Marcos |" We've gathered you, who are qualified
to be the dragon's priestess, "
 Marcos |" because a new prophecy has been
engraved in the Dragon Stone. "
 Marcos |" It says, ""From the five capable of
becoming the nation's new leader, "
 Marcos |" choose one priestess to enter into
a covenant with the dragon."" "
 Subaru Natsuki | Five? 
 Reinhard van Astrea | Yes, five. 
 Reinhard van Astrea | Currently, there are only four candidates. 
 Reinhard van Astrea | The royal selection hadn't even begun. 
 Reinhard van Astrea | But today, 
 Reinhard van Astrea | history is set in motion. 
 Marcos | Knight Reinhard van Astrea, come forward. 
 Reinhard van Astrea | Yes, sir. 
 Reinhard van Astrea | Honored members of the council of wise men, 
 Reinhard van Astrea |" I, Reinhard van Astrea,
of the Imperial Knights, "
 Reinhard van Astrea |" would like to announce
my mission's completion. "
 Reinhard van Astrea |" The dragon's priestess, the fifth and
final candidate for the throne, "
 Reinhard van Astrea | has been located. 
 Reinhard van Astrea | The one I, myself, revere as queen. 
 Reinhard van Astrea | Her name... 
 Reinhard van Astrea | is Felt-sama. 
 Reinhard van Astrea |" Felt-sama, thank you for gracing us
with your presence. "
 Felt | Reinhard... 
 Felt | You bastard! 
 Felt |" You dragged me here with no explanation,
and what do you call all this?! "
 Reinhard van Astrea | You surprised me... 
 Reinhard van Astrea | What's brought on such behavior? 
 Felt |" Don't block my kick and ask me
that, like nothing happened! "
 Felt | I've had just about all I can take! 
 Reinhard van Astrea | Does the dress not suit your taste? 
 Reinhard van Astrea | It looks lovely on you. 
 Felt |" I'm not talking about the dress,
and I'm not embarrassed! "
 Emilia | That's the girl from... 
 Subaru Natsuki |" I guess it isn't that easy to change
someone at their core... "
 Subaru Natsuki | And not only me. 
 Felt | What the heck are you doing here? 
 Subaru Natsuki |" Hey! It's been a while.
How have you be— "
 Subaru Natsuki | Randaba! 
 Felt |" Looks like the hole in your gut
isn't bothering you anymore. "
 Subaru Natsuki |" If you were worried about that,
be nice to me! "
 Marcos |" Felt-sama, if you have finished
rekindling old friendships, "
 Marcos | please step over here. 
 Felt | So, what is it you want me to do? 
 Reinhard van Astrea |" I would like to say,
""To act more like a lady,"" "
 Reinhard van Astrea | but this comes first. 
 Reinhard van Astrea | As you can see, 
 Reinhard van Astrea |" the dragon gem has recognized
Felt-sama as a priestess. "
 Reinhard van Astrea | With her participation approved, 
 Reinhard van Astrea |" I believe it is time to begin the
royal selection in earnest. "
 Rickert | Even if the Dragon Stone has recognized her, 
 Rickert | isn't her selection a bit problematic? 
 Marcos |" You believe we, the Imperial Knights,
have made an error? "
 Subaru Natsuki | The atmosphere's getting kind of dicey. 
 Aldebaran | Yeah, but it doesn't bother me. 
 Felix Argyle | It's nyo big deal to me, either... 
 Felix Argyle |" After all, I've already pledged my
loyalty exclusively to one lady! "
 Julius Euclius | I feel the same. 
 Julius Euclius | My sword already belongs to Anastasia-sama. 
 Subaru Natsuki |" Well, my feelings for Emilia won't
come in second to anyone! "
 EXTRA |" She doesn't have the self-awareness
to become a ruler. "
 EXTRA |" You can dress her up, but you
can't give her grace. "
 EXTRA | She's uneducated, as well. 
 Miklotov | Silence! 
 Miklotov | Knight Reinhard, 
 Miklotov |" would you begin by explaining to us
what led you to her discovery? "
 Reinhard van Astrea |" I took custody of Felt-sama in the slums,
about one month ago. "
 Rickert | She's a gutter rat from the slums?! 
 Felt | Well, sorry for being a gutter rat! 
 Felt |" You were the ones who dragged
me here against my will! "
 Priscilla Barielle |" All of this long-winded blather
could not be more tedious. "
 Priscilla Barielle | Of course, I suppose you lived as a gutter rat 
 Priscilla Barielle |" because you could only manage
tedious conversation... "
 Felt | Oh? If you want a fight, you've got one. 
 Priscilla Barielle | What insolence. 
 Priscilla Barielle | Who do you think I am? 
 Aldebaran | Princess, that isn't... 
 Reinhard van Astrea | Many pardons, Priscilla-sama. 
 Emilia |" What are you thinking,
in a hallowed place like this? "
 Priscilla Barielle |" I was only trying to teach an
untrained little bitch her place. "
 Emilia | You won't even apologize? 
 Priscilla Barielle | Then, will you also apologize for being born? 
 Priscilla Barielle | You silver-haired half-elf. 
 Emilia | I have no connection to the witch... 
 Aldebaran | Princess, could you drop it now? 
 Aldebaran |" I'll be the one to suffer if you
make too many enemies, seriously. "
 Miklotov | Are you all quite finished? 
 Marcos |" Then, royal selection candidates,
please come forth. "
 Marcos | Priscilla Barielle-sama and her attendant, Al. 
 Priscilla Barielle | This selection is pointless. 
 Priscilla Barielle | I am the one suited to rule this nation! 
 Priscilla Barielle |" All you need to do is serve
me and grovel at my feet. "
 Marcos |" Head of the Karsten family,
Crusch Karsten-sama, "
 Marcos | and her attendant, the knight Felix Argyle. 
 Crusch Karsten | Should I become the new ruler, 
 Crusch Karsten |" I will make the dragon forget
the covenant it demanded. "
 Crusch Karsten |" The Dragon's Empire of Lugunica
belongs not to the dragon, "
 Crusch Karsten | but to us. 
 Marcos |" Anastasia Hoshin-sama,
of the Hoshin Company, "
 Marcos | and her attendant, the knight Julius Euclius. 
 Anastasia Hoshin | I'm a greedy gal, so I want everything. 
 Anastasia Hoshin |" No amount of commercial
success can satisfy me. "
 Anastasia Hoshin | I want my own nation! 
 Marcos | Emilia-sama and the man endorsing her, 
 Marcos | Margrave Roswaal L. Mathers. 
 Emilia | I have only one wish. 
 Emilia | For all to be equal. 
 Emilia |" I desire to create a nation where
all citizens are equal! "
 Roswaal L. Mathers |" Still, after the introduction of
all those knightly attendants, "
 Roswaal L. Mathers | I feel terribly out of place here! 
 Marcos | Finally, Felt-sama and her attendant, 
 Marcos | the knight Reinhard van Astrea. 
 Felt | Hang on! Don't get the wrong idea! 
 Felt | I never said I'd be the next ruler... 
 Felt | Who'd want to be in a royal selection?! 
 Marcos |" Are you saying you withdraw
from the selection? "
 Felt | Damn right I am! 
 Rickert | This is a joke! 
 Rickert |" I've overlooked this because
the situation is dire, "
 Rickert | but to drag it out this long is senseless! 
 Bordeaux | He's right. 
 Bordeaux |" The Astrea family offers
a gutter rat to rule us, "
 Bordeaux |" while Margrave Mathers endorses
a half-devil? Utter foolishness! "
 Roswaal L. Mathers |" It isn't at all nice to call
a half-elf a ""half-devil."" "
 Bordeaux | That silver-haired half-devil 
 Bordeaux |" matches the Jealous Witch's appearance,
as described for generations! "
 Bordeaux |" Why do you not realize that even allowing
her in the throne room is dreadful? "
 Bordeaux | Filthy woman! 
 Subaru Natsuki | Enough of your crap! 
 Emilia | Subaru, it's all right! Stop this! 
 Subaru Natsuki | I will not stop! 
 Subaru Natsuki | You people are full of crap! 
 Emilia | Apologize to Emilia— 
 Subaru Natsuki | Subaru! 
 Emilia |" Allow me to formally introduce myself
to the honored council of elders. "
 Emilia | My name is Emilia. 
 Emilia |" I am accompanied by Puck, a great
spirit who controls fire, "
 Emilia | and I am a silver-haired half-elf. 
 EXTRA | A great spirit? 
 Emilia | I understand that my half-elf lineage, 
 Emilia |" and other similarities to the witch,
subject me to prejudice. "
 Emilia | However... 
 Emilia |" I adamantly refuse to let all my potential
be plucked out simply for that reason. "
 Subaru Natsuki | Emilia... 
 Miklotov | By the way... 
 Miklotov | What, exactly, is that young man's position? 
 Emilia | Huh? Um, well, he's... 
 Subaru Natsuki | It's okay, Emilia. I've made up my mind, too. 
 Emilia | Your mind? To do what? 
 Emilia | Hey, Subaru, what are you going to do? 
 Emilia | Wait! 
 Subaru Natsuki |" Nice to meet you, members of
the council of elders. "
 Subaru Natsuki | My name is Natsuki Subaru. 
 Subaru Natsuki |" I am a manservant in Roswaal's mansion,
and I serve as this candidate's... "
 Subaru Natsuki | Emilia-sama's best knight! 
 Miklotov | Hmm, a knight, is he? 
 Roswaal L. Mathers | Ah, he knows little of our world... 
 Julius Euclius | Forgive me for interrupting, 
 Julius Euclius | but there is something I must ask him... 
 Julius Euclius |" If you truly proclaim yourself
to be Emilia-sama's knight. "
 Subaru Natsuki | What do you mean by that? 
 Julius Euclius | You just declared that you are a knight. 
 Julius Euclius |" And you did so here, audaciously,
before the Knights of Lugunica! "
 Subaru Natsuki | That was pretty well-coordinated... 
 Subaru Natsuki | Did you guys practice that for this meeting? 
 Julius Euclius | Of course. 
 Julius Euclius |" To make known to all the
dignity of our empire, "
 Julius Euclius |" we are highly conscious of
our identities every day. "
 Julius Euclius | Do you have the resolve to match that? 
 Subaru Natsuki | I want to make Emilia-sama the ruler... 
 Subaru Natsuki | No, I will make her the ruler! 
 Julius Euclius |" And you believe you have the
resolve and strength for that? "
 Subaru Natsuki | I don't have anything as grand as resolve, 
 Subaru Natsuki | and I'm well aware that I lack strength. 
 Subaru Natsuki | But I'm going to make Emilia the ruler! 
 Subaru Natsuki | I'm going to make her wish come true! 
 Julius Euclius |" Do you not feel that your answer
is too arrogant by far? "
 Julius Euclius |" Weakness is something to feel
shame, not pride, about. "
 Julius Euclius |" To earn the right to stand here,
have you worked hard? "
 Julius Euclius | Have you done enough service to shame us, 
 Julius Euclius | the Imperial Knights? 
 Subaru Natsuki | I'm still going to make Emilia the ruler! 
 Julius Euclius | I fail to understand... 
 Julius Euclius | After being so denied, 
 Julius Euclius | why do you continue to stand here? 
 Subaru Natsuki | Because she's special! 
 Julius Euclius |" I understand and accept your
reason for standing there. "
 Julius Euclius |" But I do not think I can
acknowledge you as a knight. "
 Subaru Natsuki | What are you... 
 Julius Euclius | Anyone who inspires such an expression 
 Julius Euclius |" on the face of one they wish to
stand beside, cannot be a knight. "
 Subaru Natsuki | I-Is being a knight that big a deal? 
 Subaru Natsuki | You just happened to be born into the job! 
 Subaru Natsuki |" Don't act like a big-shot
with your daddy's name! "
 Julius Euclius | Natsuki Subaru, 
 Julius Euclius | that is not a beautiful look. 
 Emilia | That's enough, Subaru. 
 Emilia | I am deeply sorry to waste your time. 
 Emilia | I will make him stand down. 
 Miklotov | Emilia-sama, 
 Miklotov |" if nothing else, he has shown us all
that you are not one to be feared. "
 Miklotov | You have a fine attendant. 
 Emilia | Subaru is 
 Emilia | not my attendant. 
 Marcos | Natsuki Subaru-dono, please leave the room. 
 Marcos |" Now, let us discuss how the royal
selection will proceed. "
 Marcos | What's going on?! 
 Felt | What are you doing? 
 Felt | Old Man Rom! 
 Marcos | I don't know who you are, 
 Marcos |" but for stealing into
the castle, you must die. "
 Felt | Stop! Let him go! 
 Marcos | Unfortunately, I cannot comply. 
 Marcos | You have publicly declared that 
 Marcos |" you have no intention of participating
in the royal selection. "
 Marcos | I am not obligated to obey your orders. 
 Felt | Fine... 
 Felt | I'll do your stupid royal selection! 
 Felt |" You want me to try to be
the next ruler, right? "
 Rom | Wh-What're you sayin', Felt? 
 Felt | That old man is my family, 
 Felt | so release him now. 
 Felt | Treat him with care! 
 Marcos | Very well. 
 Rom | Felt... I... 
 Felt | We'll talk later, Old Man Rom. 
 Felt | Hey, Reinhard, 
 Felt | was this all part of your plan, too? 
 Reinhard van Astrea | Certainly not. 
 Reinhard van Astrea |" This was something far greater,
guided by fate. "
 Felt | Are you a slave to fate or something? 
 Reinhard van Astrea | No. 
 Reinhard van Astrea | From now on, I am your knight. 
 Felt | Fine, then. 
 Felt | I'll work you to death. 
 Miklotov | Anyway, Felt-sama and her knight, Reinhard, 
 Miklotov |" may we conclude that you both intend
to participate in the royal selection? "
 Felt | Sure, I'm in. 
 Felt | But let me just say one thing. 
 Felt | I hate the nobility! 
 Felt | I hate knights! 
 Felt | I hate this kingdom! 
 Felt | I hate everything about it! 
 Felt | So I'm planning to tear it all down! 
 Felt | How about that? 
 Rickert | Wh-What are you saying? 
 Felt | If I become the next ruler, 
 Felt |" I'll destroy everything! I'll take
down every last one of you, "
 Felt |" and bring a little fresh
air into this country! "
 Miklotov | Your mistress is quite an intense lady. 
 Reinhard van Astrea |" One day, Felt-sama's words
will reach everyone's ears. "
 Miklotov | In any case, 
 Miklotov | all of the candidates are finally here. 
 Miklotov | The royal selection will now begin! 
 Reinhard van Astrea |" And so, the royal selection
has finally begun, Subaru. "
 Felix Argyle |" Subaru-kyun , you're Emilia-sama's
knight nyow , aren't you? "
 Felix Argyle | Let's both do our best. 
 Julius Euclius | Forgive me for interrupting. 
 Subaru Natsuki | Why the hell are you here?! 
 Julius Euclius |" I wish you would not make
such an unpleasant face. "
 Julius Euclius | I didn't expect you to warmly welcome me, 
 Julius Euclius | but if you take that attitude— 
 Subaru Natsuki | If I do, then what? 
 Julius Euclius |" It will call into question the respectability
of those in your company. "
 Julius Euclius | Do be careful. 
 Julius Euclius |" Now, you asked me why
I was here, did you not? "
 Julius Euclius | I came to see you, of course. 
 Julius Euclius | I would like you to come with me for a bit. 
 Reinhard van Astrea | Julius, you shouldn't do this. 
 Reinhard van Astrea | It isn't like you. 
 Julius Euclius |" He insulted us, the knights, before the
candidates to be our future ruler. "
 Julius Euclius | And he mocked the chivalry we practice. 
 Reinhard van Astrea |" I admit that he said some
things that went too far. "
 Reinhard van Astrea |" But for such a matter, he need
only be warned and corrected. "
 Julius Euclius | No, this is not only my problem. 
 Julius Euclius | I hereby administer 
 Julius Euclius |" the death penalty to this insubordinate man,
who sullied the knighthood's honor! "
 Julius Euclius |" Normally, it wouldn't be unusual
for you to be slain for insolence. "
 Julius Euclius |" However, much to my dismay,
you are Emilia-sama's attendant. "
 Julius Euclius | Therefore, we will fight using wooden swords. 
 Julius Euclius | Shall we begin? 
 Subaru Natsuki | Sure, I'm not gonna hold back! 
 Julius Euclius | It appears you truly have no pride. 
 Julius Euclius | What a simple, vulgar way to live. 
 EXTRA | Reporting! 
 EXTRA |" Knights Julius and Natsuki Subaru-dono
are having a mock battle "
 EXTRA | with wooden swords in the training ring! 
 Emilia | How did that happen? I have to— 
 Anastasia Hoshin | I just wanna know one thing... 
 Anastasia Hoshin | Which one of 'em issued the challenge? 
 EXTRA | I'm told it was the knight Julius. 
 EXTRA | Natsuki Subaru-dono accepted, 
 EXTRA | leading to this fight. 
 Anastasia Hoshin | Well, I'm against stopping them, then. 
 Emilia |" But your knight and my,
um... friend are fighting. "
 Emilia | Aren't you worried? 
 Anastasia Hoshin | Worried? About what? 
 Anastasia Hoshin | That Julius will go too far, 
 Anastasia Hoshin | and I'll have to pay for your boy's treatment? 
 Crusch Karsten | If it is a question of the mock battle, 
 Crusch Karsten |" I cannot agree with stopping
it before they finish, either. "
 Felt | If they're just duking it out, 
 Felt |" you could've waited until it ended
and told us who won. "
 EXTRA | Yes, ma'am! But the fight was, well... 
 EXTRA | It was just so one-sided, I... 
 Emilia | I have to stop it! 
 Aldebaran | We should go, too. 
 Aldebaran |" You like to watch vicious beasts torment
weak creatures, don't you? "
 Priscilla Barielle |" Don't misjudge me with your
unfounded imaginings, Al... "
 Priscilla Barielle | But yes, I do love that. 
 Julius Euclius |" Why don't you admit that you
have reached your limit? "
 Julius Euclius |" I'm sure you have now realized,
to a painful extent, "
 Julius Euclius |" just what the knights that you insulted,
and made light of, really are! "
 Julius Euclius | I believe continuing would endanger your life. 
 Subaru Natsuki | Damn it. 
 Subaru Natsuki | I'll break... 
 Subaru Natsuki | that nose of yours. 
 Subaru Natsuki | I'll crush you. 
 Emilia | Subaru! 
 Emilia | Don't, Subaru! 
 Subaru Natsuki | Shamac! 
 Julius Euclius | This was the ace up your sleeve? 
 Julius Euclius | Your skill level is far too low. 
 Julius Euclius | Such low-level magic 
 Julius Euclius | will only work on unintelligent beasts! 
 Julius Euclius | You are irredeemably powerless. 
 Julius Euclius | You are not worthy to stand at her side. 
 Emilia | Subaru! 
 Subaru Natsuki | So I didn't die... 
 Emilia | Subaru. 
 Subaru Natsuki | That talk with the royal candidates... 
 Emilia | Subaru. 
 Subaru Natsuki | I see. 
 Subaru Natsuki | Then let's head straight back. 
 Subaru Natsuki | We need to work out a plan for the selec— 
 Emilia | Subaru. 
 Emilia | Let's talk, okay? 
 Emilia | I have some things I want to ask you. 
 Emilia | A lot of things. 
 Subaru Natsuki | Yeah, I guess you do... 
 Emilia | Why did you end up, well, fighting Julius? 
 Emilia | There must have been a reason, right? 
 Emilia | Knowing you, it must've been important— 
 Subaru Natsuki | I wanted to get him back! 
 Emilia | Huh? 
 Subaru Natsuki | I was being stubborn. 
 Subaru Natsuki |" He said I was pathetic, powerless,
and unworthy of you. "
 Subaru Natsuki |" He was trying to distance me
from you, and I hated it. "
 Subaru Natsuki | That's why I fought him. 
 Emilia | Just for that? 
 Subaru Natsuki | Emilia-tan... 
 Subaru Natsuki | Emilia, you wouldn't understand. 
 Emilia | I see. 
 Emilia |" Roswaal and I will return to
the mansion tomorrow. "
 Emilia | You will stay in the capital to recover. 
 Subaru Natsuki | Wait a minute. 
 Subaru Natsuki | Huh? 
 Emilia | Wasn't that our agreement? 
 Subaru Natsuki | But wait a— 
 Emilia |" You came to the capital so Felis
could heal your exhausted gate. "
 Subaru Natsuki | No, wait a minute! 
 Subaru Natsuki | How can you suddenly... I... 
 Emilia | Because... 
 Emilia |" When I'm with you, you always push
yourself to do the impossible. "
 Subaru Natsuki | That's not what I'm saying... I just— 
 Emilia |" ""Just""? "
 Subaru Natsuki | I just wanted to do something for you, so I... 
 Emilia | For me? 
 Emilia | It was for you, wasn't it? 
 Subaru Natsuki | No... I just wanted to do something for you— 
 Emilia |" Stop telling lies about how
everything is for my sake! "
 Emilia |" Coming to the castle,
fighting Julius, using magic... "
 Emilia | Are you saying that was all for me? 
 Emilia | I never asked you to do any of that! 
 Emilia |" Hey, do you remember
what I asked you to do? "
 Subaru Natsuki | I... 
 Emilia | I asked you to wait at the lodging with Rem. 
 Emilia |" I asked you not to use magic because
using more would endanger you. "
 Subaru Natsuki | I'm sorry I didn't do as you asked. 
 Subaru Natsuki | B-But you're wrong. You're wrong! 
 Subaru Natsuki | I... I didn't do it for myself. 
 Subaru Natsuki | You won't believe me, Emilia? 
 Emilia | I want to. 
 Emilia | I want to believe you, Subaru. 
 Emilia | I want to... 
 Emilia |" But you're the one who won't
give me a reason to! "
 Emilia | You promised me... 
 Emilia |" But just like that, you threw it away,
and came all the way here! "
 Emilia | You won't keep your promise to me, 
 Emilia | and you ask me to believe you? 
 Emilia | I can't do that! I can't! 
 Emilia | Hey, Subaru... 
 Emilia | Why do you keep trying to help me like this? 
 Subaru Natsuki | Because you helped me... 
 Emilia | I... helped you? 
 Subaru Natsuki | Yes. 
 Subaru Natsuki | You don't even realize 
 Subaru Natsuki |" how the things you've done
for me have saved me. "
 Emilia | No, I don't, Subaru. 
 Subaru Natsuki | I don't expect you to... 
 Subaru Natsuki | But it's true! You saved me! 
 Subaru Natsuki | So everything I've done has been to repay you. 
 Emilia | I told you, I don't understand! 
 Subaru Natsuki | Maybe you don't, but please listen to me! 
 Subaru Natsuki | It's the truth! 
 Subaru Natsuki | You were the... 
 Subaru Natsuki | When I first came to this world, you were— 
 Emilia | Once again, you won't tell me anything. 
 Subaru Natsuki | Why won't you understand? 
 Subaru Natsuki | I thought 
 Subaru Natsuki | if anyone could understand... 
 Subaru Natsuki | it'd be you. 
 Emilia |" The version of me that lives within
you must be amazing. "
 Emilia | She can understand everything, 
 Emilia | even if you don't explain it to her. 
 Emilia |" She can feel all your pain, sadness,
and anger as her own. "
 Emilia |" I can't understand if you
don't tell me, Subaru. "
 Subaru Natsuki | I've... 
 Subaru Natsuki | All this time, 
 Subaru Natsuki | haven't I made everything work out all right?! 
 Subaru Natsuki |" When your insignia was stolen, I saved you
from an insane killer at the loot house! "
 Subaru Natsuki | I risked my life! 
 Subaru Natsuki | All because you were important to me! 
 Subaru Natsuki | At the mansion, too. 
 Subaru Natsuki | Things worked out because of me. 
 Subaru Natsuki | Without me, it would've been a lot worse. 
 Subaru Natsuki | All of it, all of it, all of it! 
 Subaru Natsuki | All of it was because I was there! 
 Subaru Natsuki |" You should have a greater debt to me
than you could ever repay! "
 Emilia | You're right. 
 Emilia | I owe you so many debts, Subaru. 
 Subaru Natsuki | Yeah, that's right! That's why I... 
 Emilia | So I'll repay all of them now. 
 Emilia | And we'll end this. 
 Emilia | You've done enough, Natsuki Subaru. 
 Emilia | You know, I had hopes for you. 
 Emilia | I thought maybe you... 
 Emilia |" That only you wouldn't give
me special treatment. "
 Emilia | That you'd look at me 
 Emilia |" in the same, exact way you
look at everyone else. "
 Subaru Natsuki | I can't do that. 
 Subaru Natsuki | I can't look at you the way I look at others. 
 Subaru Natsuki | It's impossible. 
 Subaru Natsuki | Haven't I made everything work out all right?! 
 Subaru Natsuki | Without me, it would've been a lot worse. 
 Subaru Natsuki | All of it was because I was there! 
 Subaru Natsuki |" You should have a greater debt to me
than you could ever repay! "
 Wilhelm van Astrea | Shall we stop for now? 
 Emilia | So I'll repay all of them now. 
 Emilia | And we'll end this. 
 Felix Argyle |" I swear, Julius, your good
nature is going to waste, "
 Felix Argyle | playing the villain for someone like him. 
 Julius Euclius |" I haven't the slightest idea
what you're talking about. "
 Felix Argyle |" How could you get yourself punished,
trying to protect a guy like that? "
 Felix Argyle | It's foolish! 
 Julius Euclius |" I only acted as I wished,
true to my own nature. "
 Julius Euclius | Righteously, in my own way, 
 Julius Euclius | and without shame, as I wished. 
 Felix Argyle | Are you sure about this? 
 Felix Argyle | Old Man Wil is busy preparing, too... 
 Crusch Karsten | It was a request from our guest. 
 Crusch Karsten | I cannot ignore it. 
 Felix Argyle |" If they're just practicing,
it's nyo big deal, but... "
 Felix Argyle |" Frankly, it appears to me
he's just making excuses. "
 Crusch Karsten | Excuses? 
 Felix Argyle |" He wants to say, ""I'm just
fine. I'm working hard."" "
 Crusch Karsten | Can you blame him? 
 Reinhard van Astrea | Forgive me. 
 Subaru Natsuki | Hang on... 
 Subaru Natsuki | What do you have to apologize for? 
 Subaru Natsuki | None of this was your fault! 
 Reinhard van Astrea |" No, I am a friend to you,
as well as to Julius. "
 Reinhard van Astrea |" My own lack of virtue was
responsible for my failure "
 Reinhard van Astrea | to stop a disagreement between my two friends. 
 Reinhard van Astrea | That duel had no meaning. 
 Subaru Natsuki | No meaning? 
 Reinhard van Astrea | No... 
 Reinhard van Astrea | What came of you two fighting there? 
 Reinhard van Astrea | You were hurt, 
 Reinhard van Astrea | and Julius tarnished his own career. 
 Reinhard van Astrea |" Why not try to have a calm,
open discussion with him? "
 Reinhard van Astrea | I'm sure that will clear up the misunder— 
 Subaru Natsuki | Reinhard. 
 Subaru Natsuki | I get how you feel, and I appreciate it. 
 Subaru Natsuki | You really are a nice guy. 
 Reinhard van Astrea | Then... 
 Subaru Natsuki | But I can't accept that proposal! 
 Subaru Natsuki | We're done talking. 
 Subaru Natsuki | Go back now. 
 Reinhard van Astrea | Subaru... 
 Reinhard van Astrea | Why? 
 Reinhard van Astrea | What did you gain from that duel? 
 Reinhard van Astrea | You've only suffered losses. 
 Reinhard van Astrea | Even Emilia-sama— 
 Subaru Natsuki | You'd better head back for today, Reinhard. 
 Subaru Natsuki |" Before your mistress gets lonely
and starts yelling for you. "
 Subaru Natsuki | Mind your own damn business. 
 Wilhelm van Astrea | Shall we stop for now? 
 Rem | You must be tired after practice, Subaru-kun. 
 Subaru Natsuki | Rem, you don't think I'm pathetic? 
 Rem | I do. 
 Subaru Natsuki | You do? Seriously? 
 Subaru Natsuki |" Then why are you still here
with a pathetic loser like me? "
 Subaru Natsuki | Because you were told to? 
 Rem | The fact that I think you're pathetic 
 Rem | and my staying with you are not contradictory. 
 Rem | Besides, even if I had not been ordered to, 
 Rem | I'm certain I would have stayed. 
 Subaru Natsuki | Why? 
 Rem | Because I want to. 
 Rem | Shall we go out tomorrow, Subaru-kun? 
 Rem |" You haven't gone anywhere in the
three days since we arrived. "
 Kadomon Risch | Interested in the royal selection, too? 
 Subaru Natsuki | Whoa! Don't sneak up on me with that face! 
 Subaru Natsuki | Wait, where's Rem? 
 Subaru Natsuki |" Don't make someone without
experience watch your shop. "
 Kadomon Risch | Five candidates, huh? 
 Kadomon Risch |" If you ask me, letting a half-elf be
one of them is pure insanity. "
 Kadomon Risch |" ""Emilia,"" eh? "
 Kadomon Risch |" There's no way a relative of the
witch could become our ruler. "
 Kadomon Risch | They've gotta be crazy. 
 Subaru Natsuki | Why does everyone say that? 
 Subaru Natsuki |" It doesn't mean she has anything
to do with the witch! "
 Kadomon Risch | Huh? 
 Subaru Natsuki |" Just because she's a half-elf,
don't lump them together "
 Subaru Natsuki | and brush her off! 
 Kadomon Risch | H-Hey... 
 Subaru Natsuki | That Emilia girl... I mean... 
 Subaru Natsuki |" She might really care about this
kingdom's people, too! "
 Kadomon Risch | Hang on, why are you getting so worked up? 
 Subaru Natsuki | I... 
 Emilia | It was for you, wasn't it? 
 Subaru Natsuki | Why is it... 
 Subaru Natsuki | Because of the Jealous Witch? 
 Subaru Natsuki | You think all half-elves are dangerous, 
 Subaru Natsuki | just because the witch was one?! 
 Kadomon Risch | That's right! 
 Kadomon Risch | Everyone's scared of the witch. 
 Kadomon Risch | That's common knowledge. 
 Kadomon Risch | As long as people see her that way, 
 Kadomon Risch | she can't win. 
 Kadomon Risch | Jeez, 
 Kadomon Risch | who would actually choose to support her? 
 Kadomon Risch |" Try not to say the word ""witch""
too loudly in public. "
 Kadomon Risch | You never know who's listening, or where. 
 Subaru Natsuki | You didn't tell me 
 Subaru Natsuki | everyone felt that way about you... 
 Emilia |" I can't understand if you
don't tell me, Subaru. "
 Subaru Natsuki |" I can't understand if you
don't tell me, either. "
 Crusch Karsten |" Natsuki Subaru, would you
mind joining me for a bit? "
 Subaru Natsuki | Crusch-san... Right? 
 Crusch Karsten | That's right. 
 Crusch Karsten | Oh, yes... 
 Crusch Karsten |" This is the first time you've seen
me out of business attire. "
 Crusch Karsten | The breeze is pleasantly cool tonight. 
 Crusch Karsten | Perfect conditions for sharing a drink, 
 Crusch Karsten | as we gaze upon the night sky. 
 Subaru Natsuki | But I can't drink alcohol. 
 Crusch Karsten | You're welcome to drink water. 
 Crusch Karsten | I won't be drinking enough to get drunk. 
 Crusch Karsten | How goes the healing of your gate? 
 Subaru Natsuki | H-Hey! 
 Subaru Natsuki | Oh... 
 Subaru Natsuki | Oh... Well, it goes, I guess... 
 Crusch Karsten | I see. 
 Crusch Karsten | Well, Felis is excellent with healing magic. 
 Crusch Karsten | You can trust him. 
 Subaru Natsuki | You always seem busy, too. 
 Crusch Karsten | In response to a certain occurrence, 
 Crusch Karsten |" my family is currently gathering
people and objects. "
 Crusch Karsten |" Plus, since word of the
royal selection spread, "
 Crusch Karsten | I've received proposals every day. 
 Crusch Karsten | I'm sure the other candidates have, as well. 
 Subaru Natsuki | P-Proposals?! 
 Subaru Natsuki | You mean, as in marriage? 
 Subaru Natsuki | Oh, yeah. 
 Subaru Natsuki | I guess they're all single... 
 Crusch Karsten | Does that bother you? 
 Subaru Natsuki | Not really. It's just... 
 Subaru Natsuki | Oh, right! 
 Subaru Natsuki | Wilhelm-san said he had a beautiful wife. 
 Crusch Karsten | Are you aware that Wilhelm serves me? 
 Subaru Natsuki | Huh? Why? 
 Felix Argyle | What are nyou doing here, Subaru-kyun ? 
 Felix Argyle | And Crusch-sama! 
 Felix Argyle | Why are you dressed so vulnerably?! 
 Crusch Karsten | Is it strange? 
 Crusch Karsten |" It's no different than what
I wear to dine with you. "
 Felix Argyle | That's exactly the problem! 
 Felix Argyle | Men are nyo thing but wolves! 
 Subaru Natsuki | You're a man, too. 
 Crusch Karsten | That's enough joking, Felis. 
 Crusch Karsten | All who were present at the royal selection 
 Crusch Karsten | know whom Subaru loves. 
 Felix Argyle | Yeah. I heard they had a fight, though. 
 Felix Argyle | I swear, Subaru-kyun , you're so easy to read! 
 Crusch Karsten | Don't cast your gaze down, Natsuki Subaru. 
 Subaru Natsuki | Huh? 
 Crusch Karsten | When your eyes are clouded, your soul darkens. 
 Crusch Karsten | That means your future is closed to you, 
 Crusch Karsten | and you lose sight of your reasons to live. 
 Crusch Karsten | When you do what you know to be right, 
 Crusch Karsten | what can you do by looking downward? 
 Crusch Karsten | Lift your head, face forward, 
 Crusch Karsten | and reach out your hands. 
 Crusch Karsten |" I do not want to regard you
as an insignificant enemy. "
 Felix Argyle | If Crusch-sama says so, 
 Felix Argyle | you have nyo choice. 
 Felix Argyle |" The point is, Subaru-kyun , you need to
hurry and make up with Emilia-sama. "
 Felix Argyle | Think about what you can do 
 Felix Argyle | to accomplish that, and do it. 
 Subaru Natsuki | What I can do? 
 Subaru Natsuki | There is something I can do. 
 Subaru Natsuki | Something that only I can do. 
 Subaru Natsuki | Yeah, that's right... 
 Subaru Natsuki | You don't even have to tell me. 
 Crusch Karsten | The wind is picking up. 
 Crusch Karsten |" It looks as if the weather will
be rough again tomorrow. "
 Wilhelm van Astrea | Shall we stop for now? 
 Subaru Natsuki | Don't be silly... 
 Subaru Natsuki | You've seen how far I've come in taking blows! 
 Wilhelm van Astrea |" Your attitude seems quite
different this morning. "
 Subaru Natsuki |" Last night, Crusch-san gave
me some good advice. "
 Subaru Natsuki |" If I just get a chance, I can make
any problem disappear! "
 Wilhelm van Astrea | Then, let us call it a day. 
 Subaru Natsuki | Huh? 
 Wilhelm van Astrea |" Well, I think teaching swordsmanship,
which will make a man stronger, "
 Wilhelm van Astrea |" to one who has abandoned the option
to get stronger seems meaningless. "
 Subaru Natsuki | What do you... 
 Rem | Subaru-kun! 
 Rem | We must discuss something important. 
 Crusch Karsten | Has Rem told you what's going on? 
 Rem | What I felt was... 
 Rem |" Something like a presence,
through the sense I share with my sister. "
 Rem | My sister could have used 
 Rem |" her clairvoyance to get a
clearer picture, but I... "
 Felix Argyle |" So I guess you picked up a nya sty sort
of synesthesia from her, huh? "
 Crusch Karsten | We don't know the details, either. 
 Crusch Karsten | But it came from the Mathers domain, 
 Crusch Karsten |" which you know as Margrave
Roswaal's territory. "
 Crusch Karsten |" Evidently, some troubling movement was
seen in the vicinity of his mansion. "
 Crusch Karsten | Parts of the domain are already on high alert. 
 Subaru Natsuki | Troubling movement? 
 Crusch Karsten | We did foresee this situation. 
 Crusch Karsten |" From the moment the margrave declared
his intention to back Emilia, a half-elf. "
 Subaru Natsuki |" You mean there's trouble happening
because of that prejudice? "
 Crusch Karsten | That is likely a correct summation. 
 Subaru Natsuki | The moment I leave her side, this happens? 
 Subaru Natsuki | Everyone around her is an enemy. 
 Subaru Natsuki | The only one who can take her side... 
 Subaru Natsuki | is me. 
 Subaru Natsuki | Well, then... 
 Subaru Natsuki | We have to go and help, right? 
 Rem | Y-You mustn't, Subaru-kun. 
 Rem | You have to obey Emilia-sama's orders. 
 Rem | She told you to focus on healing! 
 Rem | And I agree! 
 Rem | Healing must take priority now. 
 Subaru Natsuki | Rem, we're the only ones 
 Subaru Natsuki | who can take Emilia's side! 
 Subaru Natsuki | You heard that, Crusch-san. 
 Subaru Natsuki |" We're going back to the mansion,
back to where Emilia is. "
 Subaru Natsuki | Until it's taken care of, my healing will— 
 Crusch Karsten | Natsuki Subaru. 
 Crusch Karsten | If you leave here, 
 Crusch Karsten | that will make you my enemy. 
 Crusch Karsten | Allow me to correct one idea you have. 
 Crusch Karsten |" I have only allowed you to stay here
as a guest, receiving treatment, "
 Crusch Karsten | because I am contracted to do so. 
 Subaru Natsuki | Contracted? 
 Crusch Karsten | Emilia and I formed a contract 
 Crusch Karsten | regarding your treatment. 
 Crusch Karsten | However, 
 Crusch Karsten | if you abandon that contract yourself, 
 Crusch Karsten | I am not obligated to continue protecting you. 
 Crusch Karsten | The moment you leave this household, 
 Crusch Karsten |" Emilia and I will not hesitate
to become enemies. "
 Subaru Natsuki | I was wrong about you. 
 Subaru Natsuki |" I thought, just maybe,
you and I could get along. "
 Subaru Natsuki |" Yeah, of course... That was just a
little joke over drinks, right? "
 Subaru Natsuki | I was stupid to take you seriously 
 Subaru Natsuki |" when you told me,
an enemy, to do what I could. "
 Subaru Natsuki |" You don't want me to leave
because getting Emilia "
 Subaru Natsuki | out of trouble will be bad for you, right? 
 Felix Argyle | Nyow I think you have it all wrong— 
 Crusch Karsten | Felis, enough. 
 Felix Argyle | No, I will say it. 
 Felix Argyle | The mistake he's making is a bit too grave. 
 Felix Argyle | Even if you leave, nothing will change. 
 Felix Argyle | You'd be wasting your time. 
 Felix Argyle | After making a fool of yourself at the castle 
 Felix Argyle |" and being clobbered by Julius,
nyou still don't realize that? "
 Felix Argyle |" If you stay to finish your treatment,
you'll be much better off. "
 Subaru Natsuki | I've decided. I'm going back to Emilia. 
 Subaru Natsuki |" Though it wasn't for long,
thanks for taking care of me. "
 Felix Argyle | Is it nyot true that a good man 
 Felix Argyle | knows how to take a warning? 
 Subaru Natsuki |" It's thanks to your warning that
I've made up my mind. "
 Subaru Natsuki | Thank you. 
 Subaru Natsuki | Rem, how long until we reach the mansion? 
 Rem | About two and a half days, I think. 
 Subaru Natsuki | Over two days? 
 Subaru Natsuki | It took less than half a day to get here! 
 Rem | We cannot go that way. 
 Rem | There is a fog over the road, 
 Rem | so we need to take a detour. 
 Subaru Natsuki | Who cares about fog? 
 Rem | The fog is created by the White Whale. 
 Rem | Should we encounter it, 
 Rem | we would not survive. 
 Rem |" Thank you for lending us your
dragon-drawn carriage. "
 Rem | In my master's stead, I offer my gratitude for 
 Rem | the favor you have shown us till today. 
 Wilhelm van Astrea | It's nothing. Please take care. 
 Subaru Natsuki | Are you getting anything from Ram? 
 Rem |" No, our shared sense is consciously
controlled, to an extent. "
 Rem | This morning, I think 
 Rem |" that what I sensed was something
that exceeded my sister's control. "
 Subaru Natsuki |" So Ram didn't even mean
to let us know about it... "
 Subaru Natsuki |" Is she trying to keep
us from getting involved? "
 Subaru Natsuki | But why? 
 Subaru Natsuki | She needs me by her side... 
 Subaru Natsuki | I can save her. 
 Subaru Natsuki | Once I do, I'm sure she'll understand. 
 Subaru Natsuki | She has to. 
 Subaru Natsuki | Why are we stopping? 
 Subaru Natsuki | We have to hurry. 
 Rem | I'm sorry, Subaru-kun. 
 Rem | The ground dragon cannot go any farther. 
 Subaru Natsuki | I can't sleep. 
 Rem | Subaru-kun, are you awake? 
 Subaru Natsuki | Yeah. 
 Rem | I cannot sleep, 
 Rem | so I hoped we could talk. 
 Subaru Natsuki | Oh... You, too? 
 Subaru Natsuki | Can't help that, I guess. 
 Subaru Natsuki | You're really worried about the mansion 
 Subaru Natsuki | after what you felt through your shared sense? 
 Subaru Natsuki | It'll be fine. 
 Subaru Natsuki |" We're not the sort of lovable little kids
to get our feelings hurt so easily. "
 Subaru Natsuki | We'll get right back, and I'll fix things. 
 Rem |" Yes, I have put all my faith
in you, Subaru-kun. "
 Subaru Natsuki | R-Rem-san, um, 
 Subaru Natsuki | why are you holding on to me? 
 Rem | Because I want to. 
 Subaru Natsuki | I... I know this feeling... 
 Rem | I am healing your gate, 
 Rem | just as Felix-sama did, Subaru-kun. 
 Subaru Natsuki | O-Oh, healing! 
 Subaru Natsuki | You're healing me... Of course you are. 
 Subaru Natsuki | Because you want to, huh? 
 Subaru Natsuki |" She'll probably be angry with
me at first, won't she? "
 Rem | If you take the time to properly face her 
 Rem | and communicate how you feel with words, 
 Rem | I'm sure she will understand. 
 Rem | You are a wonderful person, after all. 
 Subaru Natsuki | I am? 
 Subaru Natsuki | Yeah... I am, right? 
 Subaru Natsuki | Emilia is hopeless without me. 
 Subaru Natsuki | Because I 
 Subaru Natsuki | care about her... so much... 
 Rem | So save just a tiny bit of that for me, too. 
 Rem | Don't go anywhere. Okay, Subaru-kun? 
 Subaru Natsuki | Rem, wake up! We oversle— 
 EXTRA | Well, now! Good morni— 
 Subaru Natsuki |" Where's the blue-haired girl
who was here with me?! "
 EXTRA | Th-The lady you were with, u-uh— 
 Subaru Natsuki | I can't hear you! 
 EXTRA | I was saying that she left during the night. 
 EXTRA | Here are your things... 
 Subaru Natsuki | What the hell? 
 Subaru Natsuki | What are you thinking, Rem? 
 Subaru Natsuki | I thought that you would understand me... 
 Rem |" ""Dear Subaru-kun. "
 Rem | When you read this letter, 
 Rem | I'm sure you will be very angry with me. 
 Rem | I shall not ask 
 Rem |" for your forgiveness for leaving you
to go to the mansion. "
 EXTRA | The one in there might agree to your offer. 
 Rem | But please understand. 
 Rem |" Bringing you to the mansion right
now would be very dangerous. "
 Subaru Natsuki | Are you the one called Otto? 
 Rem |" So please wait here for me to return."" "
 Subaru Natsuki |" So you think I'm a useless
good-for-nothing, too, Rem? "
 Subaru Natsuki | Okay, fine. If you won't trust me, 
 Subaru Natsuki | then why should I depend on you? 
 Otto Suwen | I'm sorry, but can we please turn back now? 
 Subaru Natsuki | Huh? After coming this far? 
 Otto Suwen | My ground dragon is frightened. 
 Otto Suwen |" It instinctively knows that this place
is too dangerous to approach. "
 Subaru Natsuki | Where are we now? 
 Otto Suwen | We're already in the Mathers domain, 
 Otto Suwen | near a village called Arlam. 
 Subaru Natsuki | Got it! 
 Otto Suwen |" Natsuki-san, you can't go out there!
Let's turn back! "
 Subaru Natsuki | This is far enough, Otto. 
 Subaru Natsuki | You can take the money and all my stuff. 
 Otto Suwen | I can't do that. 
 Otto Suwen | Please rethink this! 
 Otto Suwen | Natsuki-san! 
 Subaru Natsuki | What is this? 
 Subaru Natsuki | It's too quiet... 
 Subaru Natsuki | What was that? 
 Subaru Natsuki | Damn it! 
 Subaru Natsuki | I'm back... 
 Subaru Natsuki | Rem... 
 Subaru Natsuki | Rem... What happened to Rem? 
 Subaru Natsuki | Right. Rem... Rem is... 
 Subaru Natsuki | Rem... Rem... Rem... Rem... 
 Rem |" ""So please wait here for me to return. "
 Rem | When this is all taken care of, 
 Rem | I shall return for you. 
 Rem | Please take care of yourself. 
 Rem | And please... I beg you to wait for my return. 
 Rem | Please. 
 Rem | From your 
 Rem |" Rem."" "
 Subaru Natsuki | No... 
 Subaru Natsuki | No, no, no! 
 Subaru Natsuki |" If I just get a chance, I can make
any problem disappear! "
 Subaru Natsuki | This is wrong. 
 Subaru Natsuki | This isn't what I wanted... 
 Subaru Natsuki | Someone... 
 Subaru Natsuki | Someone... Someone... 
 Subaru Natsuki | Someone... 
 Subaru Natsuki | Someone... 
 Subaru Natsuki | Ram... 
 Subaru Natsuki | Petra... 
 Subaru Natsuki | No... 
 Subaru Natsuki | It's not my fault! 
 Subaru Natsuki | It's not... 
 Subaru Natsuki | Emi... lia... 
 Subaru Natsuki | Ow! 
 Puck | You're too late. 
 Kadomon Risch | Hey! 
 Kadomon Risch | You listening? 
 Subaru Natsuki | What? 
 Kadomon Risch |" Don't ""what"" me! "
 Kadomon Risch | What's with you? You suddenly spaced out. 
 Subaru Natsuki | Oh... 
 Rem | Subaru-kun? 
 Rem | Subaru-kun! 
 Kadomon Risch | Hey! 
 Rem | What's wrong? Do you feel ill? 
 Rem | Um... 
 Rem | Subaru-kun? 
 Rem | Wait, Subaru-kun... What's wrong? 
 Kadomon Risch | Hey, come on. 
 Kadomon Risch | Not in front of my shop. 
 Rem | Calm down... 
 Rem | Subaru-kun? 
 Felix Argyle | I'm pretty sure there's nyo thing we can do. 
 Felix Argyle |" His wounds are one thing, but there's
nyo helping his mental state. "
 Crusch Karsten | Can you tell how this happened? 
 Felix Argyle | No, I've checked every inch of him, but... 
 Crusch Karsten | What are the odds of it being a curse? 
 Felix Argyle |" There's nyo indication of any
interference using mana. "
 Crusch Karsten | If Felis is unable to help, 
 Crusch Karsten | no one in this household can heal him. 
 Crusch Karsten | I'm sorry. 
 Rem | Oh, no. 
 Rem |" I cannot thank you enough
for your generous concern. "
 Rem | He's right. There's no mana interference. 
 Rem | But... 
 Rem | The witch's miasma! 
 Rem | Thank you for everything. 
 Rem |" In my master's stead, I thank you
for your kindness during our stay. "
 Crusch Karsten | Give Emilia this message, as well. 
 Crusch Karsten |" ""Let us compete in a manner that
will bring neither of us shame."" "
 Felix Argyle | Hey... 
 Felix Argyle |" I know why you're returning to the mansion,
but can anyone there heal him? "
 Rem | He utters our names, only occasionally. 
 Rem | My name, my sister's name. 
 Rem | And Emilia-sama's. 
 Rem | If he sees her, 
 Rem | maybe his condition will change. 
 Crusch Karsten | I realize this is tasteless, but I must ask. 
 Crusch Karsten |" How can you give so much of
yourself for Natsuki Subaru? "
 Crusch Karsten |" Your relationship with him is not that of
master and servant, like Felis and mine. "
 Crusch Karsten | But I must say 
 Crusch Karsten |" your behavior and the glances you
cast are those a woman gives a man. "
 Crusch Karsten | I am sorry. Forget I said— 
 Rem | No, it isn't that. 
 Rem | It is... How can I put it? 
 Rem | Well... 
 Rem | I suppose it is because Subaru-kun is special. 
 Rem | Um... 
 Crusch Karsten | Forgive me. 
 Crusch Karsten | I was stunned speechless for a moment. 
 Crusch Karsten | Natsuki Subaru is a lucky man. 
 Felix Argyle | That's for sure. 
 Felix Argyle |" If he ever recovers, I'll have
to tease him to the max! "
 Crusch Karsten | Be well. 
 Felix Argyle | Good luck! 
 Rem |" I know I mustn't let my personal
feelings interfere, but... "
 Rem | I felt a little happy 
 Rem | to keep you to myself at Crusch-sama's house. 
 Rem | I cannot do that at the mansion. 
 Rem |" Even though I knew that something
was troubling you. "
 Rem | I'm sorry. 
 Rem |" Even though I heard that you'd
quarreled with Emilia-sama. "
 Rem | I'm sorry. 
 Rem | I know you'll be all right, Subaru-kun. 
 Rem | Because you are always... 
 Rem | fanatical like a demon. 
 Rem | And you're a remarkable person. 
 Rem | It's too quiet. 
 Rem | That was Sister! 
 Rem | I must return quickly. 
 Rem | Do not touch Subaru-kun! 
 Rem | Witch cultists! 
 Rem | Huma! 
 Rem | Subaru-kun! 
 Rem | Subaru-kun! 
 Rem | You bastards... 
 Rem | You stole my sister's horn 
 Rem |" and stole my reason to live,
but that wasn't enough? "
 Rem |" Now you have come here, and steal
my reason to die, too?! "
 Petelgeuse Romanee-Conti | I see... 
 Petelgeuse Romanee-Conti | This is certainly interesting. 
 Petelgeuse Romanee-Conti | You wouldn't happen to be Pride, would you? 
 Petelgeuse Romanee-Conti | I guess you're not going to answer me! 
 Petelgeuse Romanee-Conti | Ah, right... 
 Petelgeuse Romanee-Conti | I haven't introduced myself yet. 
 Petelgeuse Romanee-Conti | In the Witch's Cult, I am a Sin Archbishop 
 Petelgeuse Romanee-Conti | representing sloth, 
 Petelgeuse Romanee-Conti | Betelgeuse Romanée-Conti! 
 Petelgeuse Romanee-Conti | Ah, how comical... 
 Petelgeuse Romanee-Conti |" What a very, very, very, very,
very entertaining sight! "
 Petelgeuse Romanee-Conti | Truly, truly, truly! 
 Petelgeuse Romanee-Conti | My brain trembles... 
 Petelgeuse Romanee-Conti | Now, what has brought him here? 
 EXTRA | Dragon carriage. 
 Petelgeuse Romanee-Conti | A dragon-drawn carriage! 
 Petelgeuse Romanee-Conti | Ah, aren't ground dragons great? 
 Petelgeuse Romanee-Conti | They obey diligently, work diligently, 
 Petelgeuse Romanee-Conti |" and play their role as a species diligently!
They're just fantastic! "
 EXTRA | Killed... 
 Petelgeuse Romanee-Conti | Of course. 
 Petelgeuse Romanee-Conti |" Your diligence brought the ground dragon,
diligence itself, to the ground! "
 Petelgeuse Romanee-Conti | Ah, my brain trembles, trembles, trembles, 
 Petelgeuse Romanee-Conti | trembles! 
 Petelgeuse Romanee-Conti |" But a dead ground dragon is the
very definition of ""sloth."" "
 Petelgeuse Romanee-Conti | Clean up the area at once. 
 Petelgeuse Romanee-Conti |" With the day of the Ordeal upon us, we
mustn't allow our existence to be discovered. "
 Petelgeuse Romanee-Conti | And his friend? 
 EXTRA | Unknown... 
 Petelgeuse Romanee-Conti | It is unknown if the girl is alive or dead? 
 Petelgeuse Romanee-Conti | Unknown if she is alive or dead, yes? 
 Petelgeuse Romanee-Conti | You are truly slothful... 
 Petelgeuse Romanee-Conti |" With the forthcoming Ordeal,
you let a potential problem remain! "
 Petelgeuse Romanee-Conti |" Is this the sincerity you show
in return for our Gospel?! "
 Petelgeuse Romanee-Conti | Ah, this is sloth... 
 Petelgeuse Romanee-Conti | Sloth, sloth, sloth, sloth! 
 Petelgeuse Romanee-Conti |" Please forgive us the sloth that has
led us to betray your goodwill! "
 Petelgeuse Romanee-Conti | Love... We must repay love with love! 
 Petelgeuse Romanee-Conti | Bring the girl here. 
 Petelgeuse Romanee-Conti | If she lives, kill her. 
 Petelgeuse Romanee-Conti | If not, bring me her head! 
 Petelgeuse Romanee-Conti | Love! We must repay love with love! 
 Petelgeuse Romanee-Conti | Now... 
 Petelgeuse Romanee-Conti | Now, now... 
 Petelgeuse Romanee-Conti | Now, now, now, now, now... 
 Petelgeuse Romanee-Conti | You will look into my eyes. 
 Petelgeuse Romanee-Conti | Answer me. Answer me carefully. 
 Petelgeuse Romanee-Conti |" Why does such dense love hang,
so abundant, upon your person? "
 Petelgeuse Romanee-Conti | Do you not own a copy of the Gospel? 
 Petelgeuse Romanee-Conti | It saddens me to be ignored! 
 Petelgeuse Romanee-Conti | I'm treating you so kindly, 
 Petelgeuse Romanee-Conti |" and yet, and yet, and yet, and yet,
yet, yet, yet, yet! "
 Petelgeuse Romanee-Conti |" In that case, I will change the
order of my questions. "
 Petelgeuse Romanee-Conti | Let me ask you this... 
 Petelgeuse Romanee-Conti | Why do you 
 Petelgeuse Romanee-Conti | pretend that your mind has broken? 
 Petelgeuse Romanee-Conti | No, no, no, no. 
 Petelgeuse Romanee-Conti | I truly have my doubts. 
 Petelgeuse Romanee-Conti | Why and for what reason, 
 Petelgeuse Romanee-Conti | for what purpose, do you act crazed? 
 Petelgeuse Romanee-Conti | Your insanity is far too sane. 
 Petelgeuse Romanee-Conti |" To behave so cleverly and quietly,
as if seeking sympathy... "
 Petelgeuse Romanee-Conti | It is an insult to real madness. 
 Petelgeuse Romanee-Conti | You are a poorly-acted madman. 
 Petelgeuse Romanee-Conti |" If you really meant it, you would
pay the gazes of others no heed. "
 Petelgeuse Romanee-Conti | Ah, how comical! How comical! 
 Petelgeuse Romanee-Conti | I pity you! 
 Petelgeuse Romanee-Conti |" I pity your wretched, ugly, lowly,
diminutive, sinful being, "
 Petelgeuse Romanee-Conti | from the bottom of my heart! 
 Petelgeuse Romanee-Conti | Despite all that, you are so loved! 
 Petelgeuse Romanee-Conti |" You'd rather waste away in stagnation than
repay the goodwill shown to you? "
 Petelgeuse Romanee-Conti | You are truly slothful. 
 Petelgeuse Romanee-Conti | Oh? 
 Rem | I found you! 
 Rem | Subaru-kun! 
 Petelgeuse Romanee-Conti | How fantastic this is! 
 Petelgeuse Romanee-Conti |" A girl, a lone girl, is badly injured.
But still, she presses on! "
 Rem | Enough of your nonsense, witch worshiper! 
 Rem | To carry out your insubordinate acts 
 Rem |" in Roswaal-sama's domain,
without permission, you are fools! "
 Rem |" In my absent master's stead, I, Rem,
shall carry out the death penalty! "
 Petelgeuse Romanee-Conti | In your battered state? 
 Petelgeuse Romanee-Conti | You have only come here to retrieve this boy... 
 Petelgeuse Romanee-Conti |" You should stop saying things
that merely sound attractive. "
 Rem | Don't touch him. 
 Petelgeuse Romanee-Conti | Eh? What was that? 
 Rem | Don't you touch him! 
 Petelgeuse Romanee-Conti | That shout was great! 
 Petelgeuse Romanee-Conti | Why does a believer in love, such as yourself, 
 Petelgeuse Romanee-Conti | adhere to someone like him? 
 Rem | You know nothing about Subaru-kun! 
 Rem | El Huma! 
 Petelgeuse Romanee-Conti | Fantastic... That was fantastic! 
 Rem | Rem... 
 Petelgeuse Romanee-Conti | My brain trembles. 
 Petelgeuse Romanee-Conti | Authority of Sloth... 
 Petelgeuse Romanee-Conti | Unseen Hand. 
 Petelgeuse Romanee-Conti | Look. You must look. 
 Petelgeuse Romanee-Conti | That is the result of your actions. 
 Petelgeuse Romanee-Conti | By doing nothing, you practiced sloth... 
 Petelgeuse Romanee-Conti | And because of that, the girl is dead! 
 Petelgeuse Romanee-Conti | You killed her! 
 Petelgeuse Romanee-Conti | How awful! How awful! 
 Subaru Natsuki | You... 
 Petelgeuse Romanee-Conti | With my arm, with my fingers... 
 Petelgeuse Romanee-Conti | You... You... You... You... You... 
 Petelgeuse Romanee-Conti | killed her... 
 Subaru Natsuki | —op it... 
 Petelgeuse Romanee-Conti | It hurts! 
 Petelgeuse Romanee-Conti | It hurts, it hurts! 
 Petelgeuse Romanee-Conti | Help me! Help me! 
 Petelgeuse Romanee-Conti | Subaru-kun! 
 Subaru Natsuki | Betelgeuse! 
 Subaru Natsuki | I'll kill you! I'll kill you! I'll kill you! 
 Petelgeuse Romanee-Conti | Ah, I finally got you to call me by name. 
 Petelgeuse Romanee-Conti | I'm deeply touched. 
 Subaru Natsuki | I'll kill you! I'll kill you! 
 Subaru Natsuki | Die! Die, damn it! 
 Petelgeuse Romanee-Conti | This place is quite the mess now, 
 Petelgeuse Romanee-Conti | so I'll just leave it! 
 Petelgeuse Romanee-Conti | All right, men! You will resume your duties. 
 Petelgeuse Romanee-Conti | Rendezvous with the other fingers. 
 Petelgeuse Romanee-Conti | The Ordeal will proceed as scheduled. 
 Petelgeuse Romanee-Conti | Now, as for your position in all this... 
 Subaru Natsuki | Bastard! I'll kill you! I'll kill you! 
 Petelgeuse Romanee-Conti | I honestly have no idea what it is, 
 Petelgeuse Romanee-Conti | so I shall judge you as our Lord sees fit. 
 Subaru Natsuki | Damn you! Damn you! 
 Petelgeuse Romanee-Conti | I will leave you bound here. 
 Petelgeuse Romanee-Conti |" Should the Gospel happen
to find its way to you, "
 Petelgeuse Romanee-Conti | I am sure you will be saved... 
 Subaru Natsuki | Damn you! 
 Subaru Natsuki | Damn you! I'll kill you! I will kill you! 
 Subaru Natsuki | I'll kill you! I'll kill you! 
 Petelgeuse Romanee-Conti | Oh? 
 Petelgeuse Romanee-Conti | Ah, you are also a believer in love. 
 Petelgeuse Romanee-Conti | Yes, you sacrificed yourself for love, 
 Petelgeuse Romanee-Conti | defying your own fate. 
 Petelgeuse Romanee-Conti |" But you fell before your
feelings reached him, "
 Petelgeuse Romanee-Conti | and your love had nowhere to go... 
 Petelgeuse Romanee-Conti | You are truly slothful! 
 Subaru Natsuki |" I'll kill you! I'll kill you!
I'll kill you! I'll kill you! "
 Subaru Natsuki | I'll kill you. 
 Subaru Natsuki | I'll kill you. I'll kill you. I'll kill you. 
 Subaru Natsuki | I'll kill you... I'll kill you. 
 Subaru Natsuki |" I'll kill you. I'll kill you.
I'll kill you. I'll kill you. "
 Subaru Natsuki | Rem? 
 Subaru Natsuki | Rem... 
 Subaru Natsuki | Rem... Rem! 
 Subaru Natsuki | Rem... Rem... 
 Subaru Natsuki | Rem! Rem! 
 Subaru Natsuki | Rem! 
 Subaru Natsuki | Rem... Hey, Rem! 
 Rem | Hu... 
 Rem | ...ma. 
 Subaru Natsuki | Rem, you... 
 Rem | Live... 
 Subaru Natsuki | Rem... Wait, don't! 
 Rem | Live... 
 Rem | Love... you... 
 Subaru Natsuki | Rem? 
 Subaru Natsuki | Let's go, Rem. 
 Subaru Natsuki | Betelgeuse... 
 Subaru Natsuki | Betelgeuse... 
 Subaru Natsuki | Betelgeuse... 
 Subaru Natsuki | Betelgeuse! 
 Puck | Sleep... 
 Puck | Along with my daughter. 
 Kadomon Risch | Hey! 
 Kadomon Risch | You listening? 
 Subaru Natsuki | What? 
 Kadomon Risch |" Don't ""what"" me! "
 Kadomon Risch |" What's wrong with you?
You suddenly spaced out. "
 Subaru Natsuki | Oh... 
 Rem | Subaru-kun? 
 Subaru Natsuki | Rem... 
 Rem | Yes? 
 Rem | What's the matter? 
 Rem | You look like you've seen a ghost. 
 Subaru Natsuki | Rem... 
 Rem | Y-Yes? 
 Subaru Natsuki | Rem... 
 Rem | Yes? 
 Subaru Natsuki | I... 
 Kadomon Risch | Look! 
 Kadomon Risch |" I hate to interrupt when you're
just getting heated up, "
 Kadomon Risch |" but I can't run my business with
you two flirting there! "
 Rem | Subaru-kun, can I ask something? 
 Subaru Natsuki | What is it? 
 Rem | Well, I may be mistaken. 
 Rem | It's just that, well... 
 Rem |" The unpleasant smell on you seems
to have grown stronger. "
 Subaru Natsuki | Unpleasant smell, huh? 
 Subaru Natsuki | Then, if you're worried, keep hold of my hand. 
 Rem | Huh? 
 Subaru Natsuki | This feels a lot safer, right? 
 Rem | Yes. 
 Russell Fellow | If Crusch-sama's goal should be attained, 
 Russell Fellow |" I'm sure it would suit your
desires, Wilhelm-dono. "
 Russell Fellow | I expect the best. 
 Russell Fellow | My, how unusual it is to see you! 
 Russell Fellow | My apologies. 
 Russell Fellow |" I am the treasurer of the
capital's merchant guild. "
 Russell Fellow | My name is Russell Fellow. 
 Russell Fellow | It's a pleasure to meet you, 
 Russell Fellow | Natsuki Subaru-dono. 
 Subaru Natsuki | Wilhelm-san, who was that? 
 Wilhelm van Astrea | Russell Fellow. 
 Wilhelm van Astrea | Despite what he said, 
 Wilhelm van Astrea |" he is shrewd, dealing in all of the capital's
inner and outer financial matters. "
 Wilhelm van Astrea | Now, I was just about to head back inside... 
 Wilhelm van Astrea | Do you have something to say? 
 Subaru Natsuki | People calling themselves 
 Subaru Natsuki |" the Witch's Cult plan to attack
Roswaal's domain in three days. "
 Subaru Natsuki | I want to ask for your help in stopping them. 
 Crusch Karsten | I see. 
 Crusch Karsten | So they have made their move. 
 Felix Argyle | It seems so. 
 Felix Argyle |" Of course, from the moment that Emilia-sama,
a half-elf, entered the scene, "
 Felix Argyle | we foresaw something like this happening. 
 Crusch Karsten | I understand the situation. 
 Crusch Karsten |" My next question is how you
chose me to assist you. "
 Subaru Natsuki |" Because, to be honest, you seem
the most likely to help right now. "
 Subaru Natsuki | You've helped Rem and me— 
 Crusch Karsten | Don't misunderstand. 
 Crusch Karsten |" I helped you two because I
was contracted to do so. "
 Crusch Karsten |" If you wish to negotiate, you need
to show me what I stand to gain. "
 Crusch Karsten | Otherwise, there is nothing to negotiate. 
 Crusch Karsten | If, with my assistance, 
 Crusch Karsten |" you can eliminate the threat
posed by the Witch's Cult, "
 Crusch Karsten | what would my profit be? 
 Crusch Karsten | Tell me that. 
 Subaru Natsuki | If you help me out with this problem, 
 Subaru Natsuki | I'll owe a huge debt to your camp. 
 Crusch Karsten | Should I accept the proposal, 
 Crusch Karsten |" it would mean Emilia's withdrawal
from the royal selection. "
 Crusch Karsten | You understand that? 
 Crusch Karsten | What did you expect? 
 Crusch Karsten |" To place your own domain's survival
in the hands of another lord calls "
 Crusch Karsten | into question your ability to rule the nation. 
 Crusch Karsten | With that in mind, I ask you again... 
 Crusch Karsten | If you incur a debt to me through this deal, 
 Crusch Karsten |" it will mean the elimination of
Emilia's camp from the race. "
 Crusch Karsten | Are you sure you want that? 
 Subaru Natsuki | Even still... 
 Subaru Natsuki | I want your help. 
 Subaru Natsuki | If she dies, everything ends, anyway. 
 Crusch Karsten | Understood. 
 Crusch Karsten |" In that case, the Karsten family will
render no assistance whatsoever. "
 Subaru Natsuki | Huh? 
 Crusch Karsten |" First of all, the condition
of Emilia's withdrawal, "
 Crusch Karsten |" which you offered in desperation
as an advantage to me... "
 Crusch Karsten | It carries no weight in this negotiation. 
 Subaru Natsuki | But why? 
 Subaru Natsuki |" Isn't removing one of your rivals
enough compensation?! "
 Crusch Karsten | Are you really not aware? 
 Crusch Karsten | Emilia's elimination from the royal selection 
 Crusch Karsten | will happen with or without my involvement. 
 Subaru Natsuki | Then you'll let the Witch's Cult slaughter 
 Subaru Natsuki | all of those villagers in Roswaal's domain?! 
 Crusch Karsten | Do not change the subject, Natsuki Subaru. 
 Crusch Karsten |" It is Emilia who lacks the
power to protect that domain. "
 Crusch Karsten |" And Emilia whose people will
die for her incompetence. "
 Crusch Karsten | It is not I. 
 Subaru Natsuki |" B-But isn't knowing people will die
and not stopping it wrong? "
 Subaru Natsuki |" If you have the power to save
them, why wouldn't you?! "
 Felix Argyle | Hey, I've heard enough— 
 Crusch Karsten | It's fine. 
 Crusch Karsten | Allow me to correct one idea you have. 
 Crusch Karsten | Say the Witch's Cult does make a move. 
 Crusch Karsten | That what you say comes to pass. 
 Crusch Karsten | However, the problem comes afterward. 
 Subaru Natsuki | Afterward? 
 Subaru Natsuki | It's simple. 
 Crusch Karsten |" How do you know when or
where they will attack? "
 Subaru Natsuki | Th-That's... 
 Crusch Karsten | If you are a member of the Witch's Cult, 
 Crusch Karsten | it would make sense. 
 Subaru Natsuki | That's bull— 
 Rem | Crusch-sama, please do not make jokes. 
 Rem |" Of course Subaru-kun isn't
a Witch's Cult member. "
 Crusch Karsten | Really? 
 Crusch Karsten | Given what he says, 
 Crusch Karsten |" if he cannot explain
how he knows these details, "
 Crusch Karsten | I can draw no other conclusion. 
 Crusch Karsten |" Have you never sensed any
such inclination in him? "
 Rem | Never. 
 Crusch Karsten |" Regardless, I cannot lend
assistance to Emilia— "
 Subaru Natsuki | The Witch's Cult is coming! 
 Subaru Natsuki | They'll slaughter everyone in the village... 
 Subaru Natsuki | Kill them. 
 Subaru Natsuki | We just have to kill them! 
 Subaru Natsuki |" All we have to do is kill every
single bastard in that cult! "
 Subaru Natsuki | That will solve everything! Everything! 
 Subaru Natsuki | You get that, right? 
 Subaru Natsuki | We can't let those bastards live! 
 Subaru Natsuki | I'm going to kill them! 
 Subaru Natsuki | Please help me! 
 Crusch Karsten | Is this why you behave as you do? 
 Crusch Karsten | Your hatred for the Witch's Cult... 
 Crusch Karsten |" Is that your real reason
for approaching Emilia? "
 Subaru Natsuki | No, I— 
 Crusch Karsten |" What else but murderous intent could
one call that glint in your eye? "
 Subaru Natsuki |" You're suggesting I'm using Emilia as a
pretense for revenge against them?! "
 Subaru Natsuki |" My hatred has nothing to do
with how evil they are! "
 Subaru Natsuki | They can't be allowed to live... 
 Subaru Natsuki | That's why we have to kill every one of them! 
 Subaru Natsuki | That will save everyone! 
 Crusch Karsten | I am certain I have told you, Natsuki Subaru. 
 Crusch Karsten |" That if your own lie doesn't fool you,
it will not deceive others. "
 Subaru Natsuki | Why... 
 Crusch Karsten | You don't know why? 
 Crusch Karsten | You haven't once said 
 Crusch Karsten | that you want to save Emilia. 
 Wilhelm van Astrea | I cannot allow you to come any closer. 
 Rem | Subaru-kun, 
 Rem | please calm down. 
 Crusch Karsten |" I can generally tell when the person
with whom I speak is lying. "
 Crusch Karsten |" I am quite proud of the fact that I have
never been deceived in negotiations. "
 Crusch Karsten | Speaking from those years of experience, 
 Crusch Karsten | I can say you are not lying. 
 Subaru Natsuki | W-Well, then... 
 Crusch Karsten | You adamantly believe that your rant is true. 
 Crusch Karsten | That is nothing short of madness, 
 Crusch Karsten | Natsuki Subaru. 
 Crusch Karsten | Felis, heal his lip. 
 Subaru Natsuki | Don't bother! 
 Subaru Natsuki | Rem, let's go. 
 Crusch Karsten | Do you have anywhere else to turn? 
 Subaru Natsuki | I hope you become a great ruler... 
 Subaru Natsuki | The kind of dictator who abandons the weak. 
 Rem | In my master's stead, I thank you 
 Rem | for the care you have given us. 
 Rem | What will we do? 
 Rem | If what you say is true, we have little time. 
 Subaru Natsuki |" ""If"" it's true? "
 Rem | We have little time. 
 Rem | Shall we return to Roswaal-sama's mansion? 
 Subaru Natsuki |" No, there's not much the two of
us could do by going back now. "
 Subaru Natsuki | There aren't enough of us. 
 Subaru Natsuki | What the hell is Roswaal doing? 
 Rem |" Roswaal-sama has been required to visit
some officials within the domain. "
 Rem | He will stay with them for a few days. 
 Subaru Natsuki |" That's why he can't do
anything about the attack? "
 Subaru Natsuki |" Then, unless we find reinforcements,
we won't get anywhere. "
 Subaru Natsuki | What about Reinhard? 
 Subaru Natsuki | Wouldn't he help us? 
 Rem | Yesterday, he said that he would be 
 Rem |" away from the capital for a
while on a courtesy call. "
 Subaru Natsuki | Damn it! 
 Subaru Natsuki | Why are you all so useless?! 
 Subaru Natsuki |" Tomorrow, we'll have to look
for someone else to help us. "
 Subaru Natsuki | You head to the knights' station. 
 Subaru Natsuki |" I'm going to talk to one of
the other candidates. "
 Rem | Very well. 
 Priscilla Barielle | The Witch's Cult? 
 Subaru Natsuki | Yes. 
 Subaru Natsuki | If left alone, they'll hurt lots of people. 
 Subaru Natsuki | Emilia won't be their only victim. 
 Subaru Natsuki | I want to defeat them before that happens! 
 Subaru Natsuki | That's why I— 
 Priscilla Barielle | Amusing... You are amusing! 
 Priscilla Barielle | Indeed. 
 Priscilla Barielle |" Any jester who makes it this
far has mastered his act... "
 Subaru Natsuki | Wh-What's so funny about this? 
 Priscilla Barielle | I can appreciate your desperation, 
 Priscilla Barielle | but you haven't thought things through. 
 Priscilla Barielle |" In trying to aid your ally, you corner them,
benefit the enemy, and lose all control. "
 Priscilla Barielle | You're better off dying. 
 Priscilla Barielle |" In fact, I could just lop off your
head for you right now. "
 Priscilla Barielle |" Still, even in the face
of such harsh treatment, "
 Priscilla Barielle |" the devotion you show for your master
is commendable, if nothing else. "
 Priscilla Barielle | So... 
 Priscilla Barielle | I will give you an opportunity. 
 Subaru Natsuki | A-An opportunity? 
 Priscilla Barielle | Yes, an opportunity. 
 Priscilla Barielle |" What you would call a ""chance."" "
 Priscilla Barielle | Lick it. 
 Subaru Natsuki | Huh? 
 Priscilla Barielle | Crawl on the floor, 
 Priscilla Barielle | savoring the shame and humiliation. 
 Priscilla Barielle | And like a wretched beast, 
 Priscilla Barielle | like a baby suckling on its mother's teat, 
 Priscilla Barielle | lick my foot. 
 Priscilla Barielle |" If you can do that,
I'll consider your proposal. "
 Priscilla Barielle | If you don't want to, that's fine... 
 Priscilla Barielle | If you'd rather favor your minuscule pride 
 Priscilla Barielle |" and abandon the mistress you wagged
your tail for to the wasteland, fine. "
 Priscilla Barielle | Either choice you make will entertain me. 
 Subaru Natsuki | F-Fine. 
 Priscilla Barielle |" I guess you really are just
an insignificant man! "
 Priscilla Barielle |" What you just displayed was neither
loyalty nor devotion. "
 Priscilla Barielle |" It's something more filthy, like a dog's
dependence or a pig's greed, "
 Priscilla Barielle | you lazy pig who knows only how to want! 
 Priscilla Barielle | A pig's greed is the ugliest thing there is! 
 Priscilla Barielle | Even if the Witch's Cult is defeated, 
 Priscilla Barielle | I will strike down any camp you are part of! 
 Priscilla Barielle |" Your careless behavior and attitude
have led me to that decision! "
 Priscilla Barielle | Aldebaran. 
 Aldebaran | Hey, now... What happened in here? 
 Priscilla Barielle | Throw that detestable fool out of here. 
 Priscilla Barielle | Or kill him if you want. It matters not. 
 Aldebaran | I think that matters quite a bit. 
 Aldebaran | Let's go, brother. 
 Aldebaran | Don't get so mad, Princess. 
 Aldebaran |" That fierce look will make your
cute face drop in value. "
 Priscilla Barielle |" Unless you want your
ruined face further ruined, "
 Priscilla Barielle | take him away at once, Aldebaran. 
 Aldebaran | I've told you not to call me that... 
 Aldebaran | Can you stand, brother? 
 Subaru Natsuki | Yeah. 
 Aldebaran | You seem okay. 
 Aldebaran | I don't know what you were discussing, 
 Aldebaran | but it looks like it didn't go very well. 
 Aldebaran | If I take too long, 
 Aldebaran |" she might seriously tell
me to chop you in half, "
 Aldebaran | so I'm heading back. 
 Aldebaran | Later, brother. 
 Subaru Natsuki | That damn stuck-up bitch... 
 Subaru Natsuki |" She's forgetting that I saved
her when we first met! "
 Subaru Natsuki | Change gears. 
 Subaru Natsuki |" This is no time for those
idiots to bog me down. "
 Mimi Pearlbaton | Sniff, sniff. Sniff, sniff. 
 Mimi Pearlbaton | That looks super painful! Are you okee? 
 Subaru Natsuki | Huh? 
 Mimi Pearlbaton |" You smell like blood,
and not just from your lip. "
 Mimi Pearlbaton | Was your nose bleedy? 
 Anastasia Hoshin | Now, Mimi, no getting into mischief. 
 Mimi Pearlbaton | 'Kay! 
 Anastasia Hoshin | I'm awful sorry she's been botherin' you. 
 Anastasia Hoshin | Hmm? Aren't you... 
 Anastasia Hoshin | Right, you're Natsuki-kun. 
 Anastasia Hoshin | Emilia's knight, Natsuki Subaru-kun. 
 Anastasia Hoshin | Ain't this a coincidence? 
 Subaru Natsuki | Anastasia Hoshin... 
 Mimi Pearlbaton | Let's eat! 
 Subaru Natsuki | So, about the dragon-drawn carriage... 
 Anastasia Hoshin | You don't beat around the bush. 
 Anastasia Hoshin |" You won't make anyone happy
by prioritizin' your own goals. "
 Anastasia Hoshin |" Trying to get on the other's good side
is the basic rule of negotiation. "
 Anastasia Hoshin | That's where you're lackin', Natsuki-kun. 
 Subaru Natsuki | Sorry, but I've got a real problem here. 
 Subaru Natsuki | I want to leave the capital tomorrow, so... 
 Anastasia Hoshin | When you're up against my kind, 
 Anastasia Hoshin |" tryin' to appeal to sentimentality
is the worst strategy there is. "
 Anastasia Hoshin | But I applaud your effort. 
 Anastasia Hoshin |" It's no easy task to find a dragon-drawn
carriage in the capital right now. "
 Anastasia Hoshin | Apparently, someone's buyin' up all of 'em. 
 Anastasia Hoshin |" Here. The place at this address
should have a carriage left. "
 Anastasia Hoshin | I've signed it with my own name. 
 Anastasia Hoshin | This'll square everything away. 
 Subaru Natsuki | Don't put on airs... 
 Anastasia Hoshin | I surely will put on airs. 
 Anastasia Hoshin |" It's no fun if I just hand
it to ya normally, right? "
 Anastasia Hoshin |" I just wanted to chat with
ya about this an' that. "
 Subaru Natsuki |" Why bother with that?
You don't gain anything from it. "
 Anastasia Hoshin |" I believe there's nothin' in this
world that has no meaning. "
 Anastasia Hoshin |" You never know who might
give ya some inspiration. "
 Subaru Natsuki | What do we talk about? 
 Mimi Pearlbaton | Hey, my lady, 
 Mimi Pearlbaton | I wanna eat some more! 
 Mimi Pearlbaton | Can I order? 
 Anastasia Hoshin | Sure. Eat all ya like. 
 Anastasia Hoshin |" Oh, but don't get your mouth
all messy with sauce. "
 Mimi Pearlbaton | Wipe my face, please! 
 Mimi Pearlbaton | Yay! I'll be back! 
 Anastasia Hoshin | Despite her looks, 
 Anastasia Hoshin | she's second-in-command in my private army. 
 Subaru Natsuki | Private army? 
 Mimi Pearlbaton |" Um, um, I want this, too!
And also, um, um... "
 Anastasia Hoshin | It's quite famous in Kararagi. 
 Anastasia Hoshin |" The Hoshin Company's personal
mercenary squad, Iron Fang. "
 Anastasia Hoshin | Ain't she super cute? 
 Anastasia Hoshin | Nothing beats sleepin' with her in your arms! 
 Anastasia Hoshin |" Lately, lots of people have been
gatherin' in the capital. "
 Anastasia Hoshin |" Have you noticed the atmosphere's
different now, Natsuki-kun? "
 Subaru Natsuki |" Now that you mention it, everyone did
seem to be in a frenzy. "
 Subaru Natsuki | Because of the royal selection? 
 Anastasia Hoshin | When those on top move, the people move. 
 Anastasia Hoshin | When the people move, things move. 
 Anastasia Hoshin |" By the way, the value of things in the
capital is fluctuatin' a lot now. "
 Anastasia Hoshin |" Some of the most valuable
products are iron goods. "
 Anastasia Hoshin |" Weapons, like swords and spears, are bein'
gathered from both inside and outside. "
 Subaru Natsuki | Iron and weapons? 
 Subaru Natsuki |" They're not planning to go to war
with those things, are they? "
 Anastasia Hoshin |" It's also possible their objective
isn't to acquire the items, "
 Anastasia Hoshin | but gettin' the economy rolling. 
 Subaru Natsuki | The way you said that... 
 Subaru Natsuki |" Is it well known who's
gathering all this iron? "
 Anastasia Hoshin | It's someone you know well, Natsuki-kun. 
 Anastasia Hoshin | Duchess Crusch Karsten. 
 Subaru Natsuki | It's Crusch? 
 Subaru Natsuki |" Come to think of it, she did have
a constant stream of visitors... "
 Subaru Natsuki | I get it. 
 Subaru Natsuki | That's why that Russell guy was there. 
 Anastasia Hoshin | Russell Fellow? 
 Anastasia Hoshin | He's quite a big fish. 
 Anastasia Hoshin | This has been fairly informative. 
 Anastasia Hoshin | Thank you, Natsuki-kun! 
 Anastasia Hoshin |" After fightin' with Crusch-san last night,
you just left her place, right? "
 Anastasia Hoshin | I figured it'd be easy to learn 
 Anastasia Hoshin |" all sorts of information from your
mouth, eyes, and expressions! "
 Subaru Natsuki | You set me up from the start? 
 Subaru Natsuki | Are you happy with yourself, 
 Subaru Natsuki | using underhanded methods like that? 
 Anastasia Hoshin |" If ya want to convince
someone you're righteous, "
 Anastasia Hoshin | you've gotta show somethin' to merit it. 
 Anastasia Hoshin | And I see no such thing in you. 
 Anastasia Hoshin |" The only way to change your reputation
is to replace it with another. "
 Anastasia Hoshin |" The things you've done are what
determine your reputation. "
 Anastasia Hoshin | That is, your past. 
 Anastasia Hoshin | And there's no way to change your past, 
 Anastasia Hoshin |" so my opinion of ya isn't
gonna change, either. "
 Anastasia Hoshin | The things you've done won't ever go away. 
 Mimi Pearlbaton | You don't wanna get any closer to my lady. 
 Mimi Pearlbaton | I'm super strong, you know. 
 Anastasia Hoshin | Thanks, Mimi... 
 Anastasia Hoshin | But you don't have to do anything. 
 Anastasia Hoshin | There's nothin' Natsuki-kun can do, anyway. 
 Subaru Natsuki | Both of you are absolute scum! 
 Subaru Natsuki | Screw you both! 
 Anastasia Hoshin | I guess Julius's efforts went to waste... 
 Anastasia Hoshin | It's partly my fault, though. 
 Anastasia Hoshin |" I guess not even you would
do something that dumb. "
 Anastasia Hoshin | I'm relieved. 
 Anastasia Hoshin | Mimi, let's go. 
 Mimi Pearlbaton | 'Kay! 
 Anastasia Hoshin | One last thing. 
 Anastasia Hoshin |" The key to negotiation is how prepared
you are before ya come to the table. "
 Anastasia Hoshin |" Know what the other person wants,
and dangle it in front of 'em. "
 Anastasia Hoshin |" And since all you do is want,
that's where you're lacking. "
 Anastasia Hoshin | Now, shall we go, everyone? 
 Mimi Pearlbaton | See ya later! 
 Mimi Pearlbaton | Bye-bye! 
 Subaru Natsuki | Damn it! 
 Rem | Subaru-kun, what's wrong? 
 Rem | Did something happen? 
 Subaru Natsuki | Nothing! 
 Subaru Natsuki | Rem, how did it go? 
 Rem |" I reported the maneuvers by the
Witch's Cult to the knights' station. "
 Rem | I gave them Roswaal-sama's name, but... 
 Subaru Natsuki | Not the response we wanted? 
 Rem |" It seems the knights have received
several such reports already. "
 Rem | Since the Cult's background is unclear, 
 Rem |" they said they receive countless
unverifiable, anonymous tips. "
 Subaru Natsuki | If that's how the real cultists stay hidden, 
 Subaru Natsuki | it's no laughing matter. 
 Subaru Natsuki |" If we can't scrape a
military force together... "
 Rem | What shall we do? 
 Subaru Natsuki | We'll go back to the mansion... 
 Subaru Natsuki |" Go back and take Emilia and
Ram away from there. "
 Subaru Natsuki |" To the capital or to Roswaal...
Anywhere is fine. "
 Subaru Natsuki | Where they are now is dangerous! 
 Subaru Natsuki | There's no time. 
 Subaru Natsuki | We should leave now. 
 Subaru Natsuki |" At this pace, we should reach
the mansion by morning. "
 Subaru Natsuki |" Then we'll have plenty of time to take
Emilia and run from the Witch's Cult. "
 Subaru Natsuki | The question is how to transport her... 
 Subaru Natsuki | That's... 
 Otto Suwen | From here to the Mathers domain? 
 Subaru Natsuki | Yeah. 
 Otto Suwen | It's already late. Isn't it too dangerous? 
 Otto Suwen | We were planning to camp here tonight. 
 Otto Suwen | Would you care to join us? 
 EXTRA | You say that, Otto... 
 EXTRA | But I bet you just wanna get rid of some 
 EXTRA |" of the oil in storage that you
bought out of season, right? "
 Otto Suwen | That's not my intention at all! 
 Otto Suwen |" Though, it isn't as if I weren't hoping
you could use a little oil... "
 Rem | What's this about oil? 
 Otto Suwen | Oh, I just made a bit of a mistake. 
 Otto Suwen |" And now, I have a lot of oil that
isn't worth much right now. "
 Otto Suwen |" Even if we go to the capital, I don't
know if I can sell it all off... "
 Otto Suwen | And if I can't, I'm ruined! 
 Otto Suwen | Ruined... 
 Subaru Natsuki | Otto, I need to talk— 
 Subaru Natsuki | I mean, ask for your help. 
 Subaru Natsuki | I'll buy all the oil in your carriage. 
 Subaru Natsuki | So in return, lend us transport. 
 Subaru Natsuki | All of the merchants and carriages here... 
 Subaru Natsuki |" Anyone who'll sell transportation
for money, sell it to me! "
 Subaru Natsuki | We're transporting people! 
 Otto Suwen |" People?! We don't want any
part in human trafficking! "
 Subaru Natsuki | I'm not running that kind of side business... 
 Subaru Natsuki | There's a village near the Mathers mansion. 
 Subaru Natsuki |" I want you to take its
residents somewhere else! "
 Rem | We will, of course, thank you properly. 
 Otto Suwen | If we run through the night, 
 Otto Suwen |" we should enter the Mathers
domain by morning. "
 Subaru Natsuki | Sorry we can't take breaks. 
 Otto Suwen | No problem! 
 Otto Suwen |" Getting rid of my excess stock and
even earning transport fees... "
 Otto Suwen | I feel invincible! 
 Rem | Subaru-kun, I'm sorry. 
 Rem |" I would like to check the map to
confirm the remaining distance. "
 Subaru Natsuki | Map? 
 Rem | It is in your bag. 
 Subaru Natsuki | Oh, this? 
 Subaru Natsuki | It's too dark to see anything, though... 
 Subaru Natsuki | Ah, I know. 
 Rem | Subaru-kun, what is that? 
 Subaru Natsuki | A bit of lost technology. 
 Subaru Natsuki |" I mean, it's future technology
called a cell phone. "
 Subaru Natsuki |" I guess it's a good thing it has
some battery left, barely. "
 Subaru Natsuki | Here, look. 
 Otto Suwen | Natsuki-san, what is that? 
 EXTRA | Never seen a crystalight like that before. 
 Subaru Natsuki | It's a secret tool the margrave gave me. 
 Subaru Natsuki |" Sorry, but you should probably
forget you saw it... "
 Otto Suwen |" Whoa, why does that sound like dark dealings
that reek of nothing but money? "
 Rem | Just a bit farther, 
 Rem | and we should see Flügel's Tree. 
 Rem |" If we head northeast from there,
the Mathers domain isn't far. "
 Subaru Natsuki | Flügel's Tree? 
 Otto Suwen |" A huge tree that stands so tall in the Lifaus
Highway, it seems to pierce the clouds. "
 EXTRA |" Legend has it that, centuries ago,
a wise man named Flügel planted it. "
 Subaru Natsuki | I see... 
 Subaru Natsuki | I can't call that anything but amazing. 
 Subaru Natsuki | Where'd the guy in the bandana go? 
 Subaru Natsuki |" He didn't get distracted by the tree
and run off course, did he? "
 Otto Suwen | What's wrong, Natsuki-san? 
 Subaru Natsuki | Where'd that buddy of yours go? 
 Subaru Natsuki | The older guy in the bandana, 
 Subaru Natsuki | riding on this side of us? 
 Otto Suwen | What are you talking about? 
 Otto Suwen |" No one was riding on the
opposite side from me. "
 Subaru Natsuki | Huh? 
 Rem | Subaru-kun! 
 Subaru Natsuki |" Wh-What happened? What the
hell is going on?! "
 Rem | Subaru-kun, stay down. 
 Rem | We've lost our Windbreak protection! 
 Otto Suwen | You didn't know? 
 Otto Suwen |" Only one being with such a huge
body can fly through fog! "
 Otto Suwen | The White Whale! 
 Subaru Natsuki | Rem, do you see the White Whale? 
 Rem | I cannot! It's too dark! 
 Subaru Natsuki | What happened to the other carriages? 
 Rem | They seem to have scattered. 
 Rem | But I do not know where they have fled! 
 Subaru Natsuki | Damn it! 
 Subaru Natsuki | After we finally found some transportation... 
 Rem | Run past it, to the left! 
 Otto Suwen | Left, left, left, left, left, left, left! 
 Rem | Eat this! 
 Otto Suwen | D-Did you get it? 
 Subaru Natsuki | It didn't work. 
 Otto Suwen | Wh-Why is it targeting us? 
 Otto Suwen | There are other carriages out there! 
 Subaru Natsuki | Complaining won't change anything! 
 Subaru Natsuki | Think... Think, think! 
 Subaru Natsuki | We need a way out! 
 Subaru Natsuki |" Isn't there something?
Anything, anything, anything?! "
 Rem | Subaru-kun... 
 Rem | Please accept this. 
 Subaru Natsuki | Did you come up with something? 
 Rem | I shall get off the carriage and intercept it. 
 Rem | In the meantime, you escape the fog. 
 Rem | Otto-sama, please take care of Subaru-kun. 
 Rem | He has the payment we promised you. 
 Otto Suwen | P-Payment? 
 Otto Suwen | That's the least of our problems now! 
 Otto Suwen | We have to stay alive first! 
 Rem | Subaru-kun, I am not very smart, 
 Rem | so this is the only plan I can think of. 
 Rem | Please... 
 Subaru Natsuki | H-Hold on, Rem! 
 Subaru Natsuki | I won't let you! I won't let you go! 
 Subaru Natsuki | If... If you also die, I'll... 
 Rem | I believe I was born for this very moment. 
 Subaru Natsuki | What are you talk— 
 Subaru Natsuki | What did you... 
 Rem | It will be all right. 
 Rem |" I shall be watching over
you from behind, always. "
 Subaru Natsuki | Where's Rem? 
 Otto Suwen | Natsuki-san, you're awake? 
 Otto Suwen | Please don't move. 
 Otto Suwen |" The ground dragon's still
running at full speed! "
 Otto Suwen | I don't have time to worry about you! 
 Subaru Natsuki | I don't care about that! 
 Subaru Natsuki | Where's Rem? What happened to Rem? 
 Subaru Natsuki | Answer me, Otto! What happened to Rem?! 
 Otto Suwen | So we could escape, 
 Otto Suwen |" she jumped out of the carriage
to intercept the White Whale. "
 Subaru Natsuki | Go back. 
 Otto Suwen | Huh?! 
 Subaru Natsuki | I said to go back! We have to... 
 Subaru Natsuki | We have to save Rem! 
 Subaru Natsuki | Go back right now! 
 Otto Suwen | Wh-What good will that do? 
 Otto Suwen |" Didn't you see how terrifying that
monster, the White Whale, is? "
 Otto Suwen | That would be suicide! 
 Subaru Natsuki | I saw the monster up close! 
 Subaru Natsuki | That's why I'm telling you to go back! 
 Otto Suwen | Have you gone insane?! 
 Otto Suwen |" You want to squander
the hope that she left us? "
 Subaru Natsuki | Don't you dare talk about Rem! 
 Subaru Natsuki | You abandoned her... 
 Subaru Natsuki | You have no right to talk about her! 
 Subaru Natsuki | Go back! 
 Otto Suwen |" You still don't understand how
terrifying the White Whale is?! "
 Otto Suwen |" When a punitive force, assembled by
Lugunica, set out to subjugate it, "
 Otto Suwen |" that monster killed
the first Master Swordsman! "
 Otto Suwen | There's no way we can win! 
 Subaru Natsuki | It killed... the Master Swordsman? 
 Otto Suwen | I'm weak, and you are, too. 
 Otto Suwen | So there's no way we can save that girl. 
 Subaru Natsuki | But I know Rem isn't actually strong, either. 
 Otto Suwen | For now, we were fortunate to escape it. 
 Otto Suwen |" But in this mist, there's no telling
when it'll show up again. "
 Subaru Natsuki | Otto, watch what you say! 
 Otto Suwen | Eh? What do you mean, Natsuki-san? 
 Subaru Natsuki | Don't talk like this is some game! 
 Subaru Natsuki |" We were ""fortunate""?! "
 Subaru Natsuki | You must be joking... 
 Subaru Natsuki | Do you know how Rem felt when she— 
 Otto Suwen | Who is Rem? 
 Subaru Natsuki | Huh? 
 Otto Suwen | There wasn't anyone with that name 
 Otto Suwen | among the merchants who broke off from us. 
 Otto Suwen | Who are you talking about? 
 Otto Suwen | What do you think you're doing?! 
 Subaru Natsuki | Cut the crap... 
 Subaru Natsuki | You talk about how Rem let us escape, 
 Subaru Natsuki | and then ask who she is? 
 Subaru Natsuki | Do you have a death wish?! 
 Otto Suwen |" I'm telling you, I don't know
what you're talking about... "
 Otto Suwen | Why are you suddenly talking like this? 
 Otto Suwen |" Did seeing the White Whale
make you lose your mind? "
 Otto Suwen | Why? Why? Why is it so persistent? 
 Otto Suwen | I thought we'd left it behind! 
 Otto Suwen | Why is it only after us? 
 Otto Suwen | Even in this darkness... Why? 
 Subaru Natsuki | Rem... 
 Otto Suwen | Is... Is there some mark it's following?! 
 Subaru Natsuki | It can't be. 
 Subaru Natsuki | That monster, the White Whale... 
 Subaru Natsuki | It's a mabeast, too? 
 Subaru Natsuki | Then, it's being drawn to me? 
 Subaru Natsuki | No way. 
 Subaru Natsuki | Rem, I... No... 
 Subaru Natsuki | It's my fault! 
 Otto Suwen | Natsuki-san, please die. 
 Subaru Natsuki | Huh? 
 Otto Suwen | It's all your fault! 
 Otto Suwen | I-It's following us because of you! 
 Otto Suwen | T-Take responsibility! 
 Otto Suwen | Die! Die, so that I can live! 
 Subaru Natsuki | I don't wanna die... 
 Subaru Natsuki | No... I don't wanna die... 
 Subaru Natsuki | Help... I don't wanna die! 
 Subaru Natsuki | I don't wanna die! I don't wanna die! 
 Subaru Natsuki | I don't wanna die! 
 Subaru Natsuki | No! No! 
 Subaru Natsuki | Help me! 
 Subaru Natsuki | No! I don't wanna die! 
 Subaru Natsuki | I don't wanna die... 
 Subaru Natsuki | Huh? 
 Subaru Natsuki | Rem... 
 Subaru Natsuki | Rem, forgive me. 
 Subaru Natsuki | You're... 
 Subaru Natsuki | Where is he? Where's Otto? 
 Subaru Natsuki | I see... 
 Subaru Natsuki | Let's go. 
 Subaru Natsuki | The forest? 
 EXTRA | Huh? Subaru? 
 EXTRA | It is Subaru! 
 EXTRA | What happened to you, Subaru? 
 EXTRA | You're a mess, Subaru. You stink! 
 Subaru Natsuki | You guys... 
 Subaru Natsuki | I wasn't too late this time? 
 EXTRA | Subaru? 
 Subaru Natsuki | Rem— 
 Ram | Why are you so eagerly touching me, Barusu? 
 Ram |" I understand that, after a few days
away, you're happy to see me. "
 Ram | But don't instinctively jump on me like that. 
 Ram | It's indecent. 
 Subaru Natsuki | Oh... Yeah, that's right... 
 Ram | So, Barusu, tell me what happened. 
 Ram | You were in terrible shape. 
 Ram |" Your dislocated shoulder, split forehead,
and broken ribs have been mended. "
 Ram | But if you move too much, they'll reopen 
 Ram |" I've discarded your muddy,
blood-soaked clothes. "
 Subaru Natsuki | Oh, thanks. 
 Subaru Natsuki | The one who healed my wounds... 
 Ram | It was Emilia-sama. 
 Ram |" She didn't tell me what happened
in the capital between you two. "
 Ram | I'm not interested. 
 Ram | Judging by her reaction, 
 Ram | I'm sure you did something you shouldn't have. 
 Subaru Natsuki | That's harsh. 
 Ram | I think it's an appropriate assessment. 
 Ram | Perfect for a loser, afraid to approach 
 Ram |" the heart of the matter, who'd do
anything to put it off a little. "
 Subaru Natsuki | Rem is dead. 
 Subaru Natsuki | I... couldn't do anything. 
 Subaru Natsuki |" The fog... the White Whale...
appeared on the road. "
 Subaru Natsuki | So, to cover my escape, Rem... 
 Subaru Natsuki | But... I was left alone in the fog. 
 Subaru Natsuki | And... 
 Ram | Barusu... 
 Ram | Rem... 
 Ram | Who is that? 
 Subaru Natsuki | Huh? 
 Ram | Who is Rem, Barusu? 
 Subaru Natsuki |" Wh-What do you mean, ""who""? "
 Subaru Natsuki | Don't be ridiculous... 
 Subaru Natsuki | Sh-She's your younger sister! 
 Subaru Natsuki | You know, Rem! Rem... Rem! 
 Subaru Natsuki | This is no time for— 
 Ram | I have no younger sister. 
 Subaru Natsuki | Don't say that! If not for Rem... 
 Subaru Natsuki | That's right! 
 Subaru Natsuki |" What would you call that whole
mess in the mabeast forest?! "
 Subaru Natsuki | You, Rem, and I fought those mabeasts and— 
 Ram | Something is seriously wrong with you, Barusu. 
 Ram | I hate to admit it, 
 Ram |" but you were half-responsible
for the ulgarm eradication. "
 Ram | Roswaal-sama and I handled the rest. 
 Ram |" This long-lost sister you call
""Rem"" has no place in it. "
 Subaru Natsuki | That's not funny. 
 Subaru Natsuki | Even for a nightmare, this doesn't make sense! 
 Ram | I am always serious. 
 Ram | You must be the one who's dreaming. 
 Subaru Natsuki | Dreaming... Dreaming? 
 Subaru Natsuki | Dreaming?! 
 Subaru Natsuki | That's bull! 
 Ram | Barusu, you shouldn't stand— 
 Subaru Natsuki | Shut up! Just... Just be quiet and watch! 
 Subaru Natsuki | It can't be... 
 Ram | Barusu, are you satisfied? 
 Subaru Natsuki | Rem isn't... 
 Ram | No such person has ever lived in this room. 
 Ram | Go back to your room and sleep. 
 Ram | Your exhaustion is making you confused. 
 Subaru Natsuki |" All I have to do is run away,
run away, run away. "
 Subaru Natsuki | What good will running do? 
 Subaru Natsuki | Lend me your courage, Rem! 
 Emilia | Subaru? 
 Emilia | Why... 
 Emilia | did you come back? 
 Subaru Natsuki | Let's go. 
 Subaru Natsuki | We can't stay here! 
 Emilia | Go? Where? 
 Emilia | No... Why? 
 Subaru Natsuki | Anywhere that isn't here! 
 Subaru Natsuki |" If you have to ask why,
I'd say, ""For your sake."" "
 Subaru Natsuki | I came back for you! 
 Emilia | That again, Subaru? 
 Emilia |" You came back, covered in wounds,
and worried me to death. "
 Emilia |" Weren't you in the capital
so Felis could treat you? "
 Emilia | Why are you here now? 
 Subaru Natsuki | If... 
 Subaru Natsuki | If you protest, I'll drag you away, if I must! 
 Subaru Natsuki |" In a few days, you'll see I was right,
whether you want to or not! "
 Subaru Natsuki | So just... 
 Emilia | Wait! Wait, Subaru! 
 Emilia | What happened to you? 
 Emilia | You weren't this kind of person before. 
 Emilia | I thought you... And yet— 
 Subaru Natsuki | Just be quiet, and do as I say! 
 Subaru Natsuki | You can't stay here! 
 Subaru Natsuki | You'll regret it... You will! 
 Subaru Natsuki | No one will be saved. 
 Subaru Natsuki | I don't want to suffer and cry anymore! 
 Subaru Natsuki | Just do as I say! 
 Subaru Natsuki | Then everything will work out! It will! 
 Subaru Natsuki | Why doesn't anyone understand?! 
 Emilia | I'm sorry. 
 Emilia | I don't understand what you're saying... 
 Emilia | I want to. 
 Emilia |" But right now, I'm not sure
I have time for that. "
 Emilia | There's so much I need to do. 
 Emilia | So for now... 
 Subaru Natsuki | It won't work. 
 Subaru Natsuki | It won't work. 
 Subaru Natsuki | You won't work. You'll fail! 
 Subaru Natsuki | You can't do it. It's no use. 
 Subaru Natsuki |" You're all talk! You can't save
anyone, or be saved! "
 Subaru Natsuki | You'll keep acting rashly and unreasonably, 
 Subaru Natsuki |" until you see as many corpses as the
number of your reckless decisions! "
 Subaru Natsuki | That is your future! 
 Emilia | Why? 
 Emilia | Why are you crying, as if you're in such pain? 
 Subaru Natsuki | After... After she sent me here... 
 Subaru Natsuki | No, after she brought me here, there's... 
 Subaru Natsuki | There's something I must do for Rem's sake... 
 Emilia | Rem? 
 Subaru Natsuki | You, too? 
 Subaru Natsuki | You've forgotten Rem, too? 
 Emilia | Subaru? 
 Subaru Natsuki | Fine, I'll tell you everything... 
 Subaru Natsuki | If you all are going to forget Rem, 
 Subaru Natsuki |" I'd rather expose everything
and end up vomiting blood! "
 Subaru Natsuki | If you're coming for me, then come. 
 Subaru Natsuki | I'll gladly give you my beating heart! 
 Subaru Natsuki | Emilia... 
 Emilia | Yes? 
 Subaru Natsuki | I can use Return by Death to— 
 Subaru Natsuki | What was that about? 
 Subaru Natsuki | Usually... 
 Subaru Natsuki | Huh? 
 Subaru Natsuki | Emilia? 
 Subaru Natsuki | Don't... Wha— Huh? 
 Beatrice |" You have the look of someone who believes
he's the world's most unfortunate soul. "
 Subaru Natsuki | Beatrice... 
 Beatrice | Bubby won't come out, I suppose. 
 Beatrice | Don't worry. Bubby won't die, I suppose. 
 Beatrice |" He just returned to his
original form for now. "
 Beatrice | You have something you want to say, I suppose? 
 Subaru Natsuki | Please kill me. Right here. 
 Beatrice | You would ask me to kill you? 
 Beatrice | That's too cruel, I suppose. 
 Beatrice | You understand nothing. 
 Beatrice | You understand nothing at all. 
 Subaru Natsuki | Huh? Beatrice? 
 Beatrice | I won't grant any of your wishes, I suppose. 
 Beatrice | If you want to die, then die on your own. 
 Beatrice | Betty wants no part of it, I suppose. 
 Subaru Natsuki | What are you... 
 Beatrice | Everything is already hopeless, 
 Beatrice | but your staying here is a problem. 
 Beatrice |" I will, at least,
protect the mansion, I suppose. "
 Subaru Natsuki | Beatrice? 
 Beatrice | Betty is not like Roswaal. 
 Beatrice | Even if it would secure a future for me, 
 Beatrice | I've had enough of pain, suffering, fear... 
 Beatrice | Everything, I suppose! 
 Beatrice | At least die where I can't see you, I suppose. 
 Subaru Natsuki | Emilia... 
 Subaru Natsuki | Sorry... I'm sorry. 
 Subaru Natsuki | I'm sorry. 
 Subaru Natsuki | I'm so sorry... 
 Subaru Natsuki | Someone... Anyone... 
 Subaru Natsuki | Please kill me! 
 Petelgeuse Romanee-Conti | I've been waiting for you, believer in love. 
 Subaru Natsuki | Betelgeuse... 
 Petelgeuse Romanee-Conti | My, my, my... 
 Petelgeuse Romanee-Conti | The one you clutch to your chest there 
 Petelgeuse Romanee-Conti | wouldn't be the half-devil girl, would it? 
 Petelgeuse Romanee-Conti | How diligent you are! 
 Petelgeuse Romanee-Conti | Before we could even act, 
 Petelgeuse Romanee-Conti |" you took the half-devil's life,
in the Ordeal's name! "
 Subaru Natsuki | I'm diligent? 
 Petelgeuse Romanee-Conti | That's right! 
 Petelgeuse Romanee-Conti | You are diligent! Fantastic! 
 Petelgeuse Romanee-Conti | Still... 
 Petelgeuse Romanee-Conti | Unable to overcome even one Ordeal, 
 Petelgeuse Romanee-Conti | much less to confront one of the sins, 
 Petelgeuse Romanee-Conti | and after all that waiting... 
 Petelgeuse Romanee-Conti |" She trips over the first pebble
in her path, and it's over... "
 Petelgeuse Romanee-Conti | Ah, you are 
 Petelgeuse Romanee-Conti | truly slothful... 
 Petelgeuse Romanee-Conti | You saw the Unseen Hand just now? 
 Petelgeuse Romanee-Conti | No... 
 Petelgeuse Romanee-Conti | That's bad. 
 Petelgeuse Romanee-Conti | This isn't right! It's all wrong! 
 Petelgeuse Romanee-Conti | It's a mistake! A mistake! 
 Petelgeuse Romanee-Conti | My Authority... 
 Petelgeuse Romanee-Conti | The Authority of Sloth... 
 Petelgeuse Romanee-Conti | My Unseen Hand, which love granted to me... 
 Petelgeuse Romanee-Conti | No other can be allowed to see it! 
 Petelgeuse Romanee-Conti |" You held her, as if she were
terribly precious to you... "
 Petelgeuse Romanee-Conti |" But when the half-devil's body is torn
apart, how beautifully will you cry? "
 Subaru Natsuki | Stop... 
 Subaru Natsuki | Stop! 
 Subaru Natsuki | Please stop! 
 Puck | What are you doing? 
 Puck | What are you doing to my daughter, 
 Puck | you scum? 
 Puck | Die. 
 Petelgeuse Romanee-Conti | My brain trembles... 
 Subaru Natsuki | Puck! 
 Puck | Be quiet, Subaru. 
 Puck | I don't care what you— 
 Petelgeuse Romanee-Conti | Complacency! Negligence! That is sloth! 
 Petelgeuse Romanee-Conti | You should have killed me right away! 
 Petelgeuse Romanee-Conti | Even with the power you have, 
 Petelgeuse Romanee-Conti | you failed to do what you needed to do! 
 Puck | Foolishness. 
 Puck | If you truly want to kill me... 
 Puck |" Then grow a thousand shadows,
half of what Satella could... "
 Subaru Natsuki | Are you... Puck? 
 Puck | Can't you tell? 
 Puck | Maybe it's cruel of me to ask that. 
 Petelgeuse Romanee-Conti | Unbelievable... 
 Petelgeuse Romanee-Conti | This is unbelievable! 
 Petelgeuse Romanee-Conti | It cannot be! 
 Petelgeuse Romanee-Conti | A mere spirit... 
 Petelgeuse Romanee-Conti | My faith... 
 Petelgeuse Romanee-Conti | Everything I've devoted my love to... 
 Petelgeuse Romanee-Conti | At the hands of a mere spirit— 
 Puck |" A human who's only lived a few decades
shouldn't talk to a spirit about time. "
 Petelgeuse Romanee-Conti |" Time has nothing to do with
the depth of one's faith! "
 Petelgeuse Romanee-Conti | I wish you wouldn't liken me 
 Petelgeuse Romanee-Conti |" to a fool like you, a being
that lives for eternity, "
 Petelgeuse Romanee-Conti | but wastes most of it in idleness! 
 Petelgeuse Romanee-Conti | Ah, my brain is tremblinglinglingling... 
 Puck | Death isn't even a punishment. 
 Puck | This is why I hate all of you. 
 Petelgeuse Romanee-Conti | The Ordeal has been completed. 
 Petelgeuse Romanee-Conti | Even if my body dies, 
 Petelgeuse Romanee-Conti |" my wishes will be called to
the exalted witch's side. "
 Petelgeuse Romanee-Conti | And I'll receive her love. 
 Petelgeuse Romanee-Conti | I look forward to our reunion! 
 Puck | He quit while he was ahead. 
 Puck | Now, shall we have a little talk? 
 Puck | Subaru, you have committed three sins. 
 Puck | First, you broke your promise to Lia. 
 Puck |" You don't seem to understand
how important a promise is "
 Puck | to a spirit-arts user. 
 Puck |" Second, you ignored Lia's
wishes and returned here. "
 Puck | And third... 
 Puck | You let Lia die! 
 Puck | In accordance with my contract, 
 Puck | I will now destroy the world. 
 Subaru Natsuki | Why? 
 Puck | Lia is... 
 Puck | Emilia is my entire reason for existing. 
 Puck |" There is no reason for me to
exist in a world without her. "
 Puck | The fog is coming closer. 
 Puck |" It looks like a troublesome
one has been drawn here. "
 Puck | Gluttony... 
 Puck |" Oh, I suppose they call
it the White Whale now. "
 Puck | You called it here, let Lia die, 
 Puck | and now, you die yourself. 
 Puck | You really are useless. 
 Subaru Natsuki | I've heard this laugh before. 
 Subaru Natsuki | The voice of a man I hated to death. 
 Subaru Natsuki | No... It's me. 
 Subaru Natsuki | I'm laughing at myself. 
 Subaru Natsuki | I let Rem die, killed Emilia, 
 Subaru Natsuki | and now, I'm going to die in vain. 
 Subaru Natsuki | I really am so... 
 Puck | You truly are slothful, Subaru. 
 Rem | Subaru-kun? 
 Rem | What's the matter? 
 Subaru Natsuki | Rem... 
 Rem | Yes, I'm your Rem. 
 Rem | I'm sorry I didn't notice... 
 Rem | This crowd is tiring you, isn't it? 
 Subaru Natsuki | Tired. 
 Subaru Natsuki | Yeah, that's right... 
 Subaru Natsuki | I'm out of energy, worn down... 
 Subaru Natsuki | I'm tired. 
 Rem | Subaru-kun! 
 Subaru Natsuki | Sorry about that... 
 Subaru Natsuki | I was feeling kind of stressed, 
 Subaru Natsuki | so I skipped out on explaining. 
 Subaru Natsuki | Sorry. 
 Rem | Really, you mustn't do that... 
 Rem |" I realize that you are giving a great
deal of thought to our situation. "
 Rem |" But I don't dislike it when
you are so forceful. "
 Subaru Natsuki | Sorry that I worried you. 
 Subaru Natsuki | I'm fine now. 
 Subaru Natsuki |" I guess you've seen me just being pathetic,
depressed all the time... "
 Subaru Natsuki | But I get it now. 
 Rem | You get it now? 
 Subaru Natsuki | I've bothered a lot of people 
 Subaru Natsuki | with all my contemplating and agonizing, 
 Subaru Natsuki |" but I finally figured out how
to take care of everything. "
 Subaru Natsuki | Or, when I really think about it, 
 Subaru Natsuki | I was told what to do from the very start. 
 Subaru Natsuki | But I don't know when to give up... 
 Rem |" But I think that is what's so
wonderful about you. "
 Subaru Natsuki |" Things I've realized
and been forced to realize... "
 Subaru Natsuki | All kinds of experiences have brought me here, 
 Subaru Natsuki |" but I've actually had the
answer for a long time... "
 Subaru Natsuki | I've decided, Rem. 
 Rem | Yes? 
 Subaru Natsuki | Run away with me. 
 Subaru Natsuki | As far as we can go. 
 Rem | Huh? 
 Subaru Natsuki |" I'm going to leave the
capital, to head far west. "
 Subaru Natsuki | Or maybe north. 
 Rem | Um... 
 Subaru Natsuki | I heard no one can enter the southern kingdom, 
 Subaru Natsuki | so one of those two. 
 Subaru Natsuki | I don't like cold weather, 
 Subaru Natsuki | so I'd personally recommend west. 
 Rem | Ah, um... 
 Subaru Natsuki | Honestly, it could be a long journey, 
 Subaru Natsuki | and I know this is a snap decision, 
 Subaru Natsuki | so it won't be easy— 
 Rem | P-Please wait! 
 Rem | The way you said that makes it sound as if 
 Rem |" you plan to go to some other
country that isn't Lugunica... "
 Rem | Oh! 
 Rem |" Knowing you, it must be because
you've had another great idea! "
 Rem |" Something that will help Emilia-sama
and Roswaal-sama! "
 Subaru Natsuki | That's not what this is, Rem. 
 Subaru Natsuki | There's nothing I can do in the capital. 
 Subaru Natsuki |" But I'd be just as powerless if
I went back to the mansion. "
 Subaru Natsuki | That's what I figured out. 
 Subaru Natsuki | So run away with me, Rem. 
 Subaru Natsuki | We can't stay here. 
 Subaru Natsuki | That's what everyone has been telling me. 
 Subaru Natsuki | I didn't want to believe it, 
 Subaru Natsuki | so I've denied it with all my might, but... 
 Subaru Natsuki | Yeah, they're right. 
 Subaru Natsuki | No one ever needed me. 
 Rem | That's not— 
 Subaru Natsuki | It is true! 
 Subaru Natsuki | It's been spelled out for me, over and over... 
 Subaru Natsuki | That's why I've decided to just disappear. 
 Subaru Natsuki | It's for the best. 
 Subaru Natsuki | Anything I do will just lead to a dead body... 
 Subaru Natsuki | Or maybe more, depending on what happens. 
 Subaru Natsuki | I've had enough. 
 Subaru Natsuki | Let's run, Rem. 
 Subaru Natsuki | You and I can't stay here. 
 Subaru Natsuki | We shouldn't be in this country! 
 Rem | But this is so sudden... 
 Subaru Natsuki | We don't have time! 
 Subaru Natsuki | I'm sorry it's sudden, I really am. 
 Subaru Natsuki | I really, really am. 
 Subaru Natsuki | But you have to choose. 
 Rem | Choose? 
 Subaru Natsuki | Me? Or someone else? 
 Subaru Natsuki | Choose. 
 Subaru Natsuki |" Let's get a dragon-drawn
carriage and head west. "
 Subaru Natsuki |" We'll leave Lugunica and go far
west... To Kararagi, was it? "
 Subaru Natsuki |" We'll buy a little house
and live there together. "
 Subaru Natsuki | Even if bad things happen, 
 Subaru Natsuki | I can keep going if you're there. 
 Subaru Natsuki |" Just having someone waiting at
home for me with a smile... "
 Subaru Natsuki | No matter how tired I am, 
 Subaru Natsuki | if I know you're waiting for me, I know... 
 Subaru Natsuki | Please choose me! 
 Subaru Natsuki |" If you choose me, I'll
give you all that I have! "
 Subaru Natsuki | So please... 
 Subaru Natsuki | Run away with me. 
 Subaru Natsuki | Live with me! 
 Rem | Subaru-kun... 
 Rem | I cannot run away with you. 
 Rem | We're supposed to laugh together, 
 Rem | as we talk about the future, remember? 
 Subaru Natsuki | Maybe we can't laugh now, but... 
 Subaru Natsuki | You know, once we actually get moving, 
 Subaru Natsuki | I bet we can— 
 Rem | I have thought about it, too. 
 Rem | We would arrive in Kararagi, 
 Rem | and rent a place to stay. 
 Rem | As long as we had a home and work, 
 Rem | we would get by somehow. 
 Rem |" Fortunately, thanks to Roswaal-sama,
I have received an education, "
 Rem |" so I think I could easily find
work, even in Kararagi. "
 Rem |" You might have to either
look for manual labor "
 Rem | or take care of things around me. 
 Rem | Once we had a stable income, 
 Rem | we could look for a better place to live. 
 Rem | In the meantime, you could study 
 Rem | for perhaps a year, so that you can find 
 Rem | a decent job, until you can actually work. 
 Rem | We would work together. 
 Rem |" And once we had enough money,
perhaps we could buy a house. "
 Rem | Maybe we could even open a shop. 
 Rem |" After all, Kararagi is a
thriving commercial area. "
 Rem |" I'm sure we could earn a living
on one of your fanciful ideas. "
 Rem | And once our jobs were on track... 
 Rem | Um, it's embarrassing to say, 
 Rem | but we could have a child. 
 Rem | It would be half-demon and half-human, 
 Rem | so I'm certain it would be feisty. 
 Rem | Whether we have a boy or a girl, 
 Rem | twins or even triplets, 
 Rem | I know they would be adorable. 
 Rem | I'm sure it wouldn't be all fun times. 
 Rem |" And not everything would
work out as I imagined it. "
 Rem | We might have only daughters and no sons, 
 Rem |" so you might not feel very
proud of your family. "
 Subaru Natsuki | Rem... 
 Rem | But... But... Even when the children grow 
 Rem |" and reach the age where they
start to treat you coldly, "
 Rem | I shall still be on your side! 
 Rem |" We will be famous in the neighborhood
as a couple of old lovebirds, "
 Rem |" as we take our time spending life
together and growing old... "
 Subaru Natsuki | Rem... 
 Rem | I would feel bad for doing it to you, 
 Rem |" but I would prefer to die
before you, if possible. "
 Rem | I want to die quietly, 
 Rem | lying on our bed, with your hand in mine, 
 Rem | surrounded by our children and their children. 
 Rem |" To say, ""I was so happy,"" "
 Rem | as you all look on... 
 Rem | I could end my life happily, so happily. 
 Subaru Natsuki | If you... 
 Subaru Natsuki | If you want it that badly, then... 
 Rem |" If you could wish for that
future with a smile, "
 Rem | I would be truly happy to die that way... 
 Rem | As long as I could live with you. 
 Rem |" Just knowing that you want me
with you when you run away "
 Rem | makes me happy, from the bottom of my heart. 
 Rem | But I cannot. 
 Rem | Because I know 
 Rem | that if we run away together now, 
 Rem |" I would be leaving behind the
Subaru-kun that I love most. "
 Rem | Subaru-kun, 
 Rem | please tell me what happened. 
 Rem | If you cannot, please trust me. 
 Rem | I swear I shall do something to make it right. 
 Rem | But for now, at least, we should go back. 
 Rem |" If we take our time,
and consider things calmly, "
 Rem | maybe we will find a different answer. 
 Subaru Natsuki | I've already agonized over this. 
 Subaru Natsuki | I've thought about it. 
 Subaru Natsuki | I've suffered. 
 Subaru Natsuki | That's why I gave up. 
 Rem | It's easy to give up, but... 
 Subaru Natsuki | It's easy to give up? 
 Rem | Subaru-kun? 
 Subaru Natsuki | Don't give me that! 
 Subaru Natsuki | There's nothing easy about giving up! 
 Subaru Natsuki | You think I'm just doing nothing, 
 Subaru Natsuki | thinking about nothing, 
 Subaru Natsuki | cutting myself off from everything, 
 Subaru Natsuki | and throwing everything away! 
 Subaru Natsuki | And that's all it took to give up?! 
 Subaru Natsuki | It was not easy to give up! 
 Subaru Natsuki | It was so much easier for me to think 
 Subaru Natsuki | there was something I could do! 
 Subaru Natsuki | But there's nothing I can do... 
 Subaru Natsuki | There's no way out! 
 Subaru Natsuki |" The only path everything
leads to is giving up! "
 Subaru Natsuki | If I could do something, 
 Subaru Natsuki | I would... I would... 
 Rem | Subaru-kun... 
 Rem | It is easy to give up. 
 Rem | But it doesn't suit you. 
 Rem |" I do not know what painful things
you've been through, "
 Rem | or what you have done to make you suffer so. 
 Rem | And I know it would be wrong of me 
 Rem | to thoughtlessly say I understand. 
 Rem | But... But even so... 
 Rem | There is something that I do know. 
 Rem |" I know that you're someone who cannot
give up on something halfway through. "
 Rem | I know that you are someone who can smile 
 Rem |" when you talk about your
wishes for the future. "
 Rem | I know... 
 Rem |" I know that you are someone who
cannot give up on the future. "
 Subaru Natsuki | You're wrong. 
 Subaru Natsuki | I'm not that kind of— 
 Rem | I am not wrong. 
 Rem | You haven't given up on anyone. 
 Rem | Not Emilia-sama or Sister. 
 Rem |" Or Roswaal-sama, or Beatrice-sama,
or anyone else. "
 Subaru Natsuki | I have... I have given up! 
 Subaru Natsuki | Carrying it all was impossible from the start! 
 Subaru Natsuki | My hands are so small, 
 Subaru Natsuki |" that it all slipped through
my fingers, leaving nothing. "
 Rem | No, that isn't true. You have— 
 Subaru Natsuki | What do you know?! 
 Subaru Natsuki | What do you know about me?! 
 Subaru Natsuki | This is the kind of man I am! 
 Subaru Natsuki | I have no strength, but I want it all. 
 Subaru Natsuki | I have no knowledge, but all I do is dream. 
 Subaru Natsuki |" There's nothing I can do,
but I struggle in vain! "
 Subaru Natsuki | I... I... 
 Subaru Natsuki | I hate myself! 
 Subaru Natsuki | All I do is talk a big game, 
 Subaru Natsuki |" and make myself sound like a big shot,
when I can't do anything! "
 Subaru Natsuki | I never do anything, 
 Subaru Natsuki | yet I can complain like a pro. 
 Subaru Natsuki | Who do I think I am?! 
 Subaru Natsuki |" It's amazing that I can live like
this and not feel ashamed! "
 Subaru Natsuki | Right?! 
 Subaru Natsuki | I'm empty... 
 Subaru Natsuki | There's nothing in me at all! 
 Subaru Natsuki | I know that... 
 Subaru Natsuki | Yeah, that's obvious... 
 Subaru Natsuki | I know it's obvious. 
 Subaru Natsuki | Before I came here... 
 Subaru Natsuki |" Before I got into the situation
that led me to all of you, "
 Subaru Natsuki | do you have any idea what I did? 
 Subaru Natsuki | I did nothing... 
 Subaru Natsuki | I've never done a single thing. 
 Subaru Natsuki | I had all that time, all that freedom... 
 Subaru Natsuki | I could have done anything, 
 Subaru Natsuki | but I never did a thing. 
 Subaru Natsuki |" And this is the result! What I
am now is the result! "
 Subaru Natsuki |" All of my powerlessness,
all of my incompetence, "
 Subaru Natsuki | is the product of my rotten character. 
 Subaru Natsuki |" Wanting to accomplish something,
when I've never done anything, "
 Subaru Natsuki | goes beyond the limits of arrogance! 
 Subaru Natsuki |" The cost of my laziness and all
the wasteful habits in my life "
 Subaru Natsuki | just ends up killing both you and me. 
 Subaru Natsuki | That's right. 
 Subaru Natsuki | I have no character. 
 Subaru Natsuki |" Even when I thought I could go on
living here, nothing changed... "
 Subaru Natsuki | That old man saw that part of me perfectly. 
 Subaru Natsuki | Right? 
 Subaru Natsuki | I wasn't trying to get stronger, 
 Subaru Natsuki | or trying to make things better. 
 Subaru Natsuki |" I was just striking an obvious
pose, to justify myself, "
 Subaru Natsuki |" to say that I was trying, that it wasn't
like I wasn't doing anything. "
 Subaru Natsuki | I wanted to say I couldn't help it. 
 Subaru Natsuki |" I wanted to be told that
it couldn't be helped! "
 Subaru Natsuki |" I only pretended to push my body to the
limit, so that would be possible! "
 Subaru Natsuki | Even when I had you help me study, 
 Subaru Natsuki |" I was just posing to cover up
how embarrassed I felt! "
 Subaru Natsuki | At heart, 
 Subaru Natsuki |" I'm just a small, cowardly,
filthy piece of trash, "
 Subaru Natsuki |" who's always worried about how
others see me. And nothing... "
 Subaru Natsuki | Nothing about me has changed! 
 Subaru Natsuki | I knew it all along. 
 Subaru Natsuki | That all of it was my fault... 
 Subaru Natsuki | I'm the lowest of the low. 
 Subaru Natsuki | I absolutely hate myself... 
 Rem | I know... 
 Rem |" That no matter how deeply you
have fallen into darkness, "
 Rem |" you still have the courage
to reach out your hand. "
 Rem | I love it when you stroke my hair. 
 Rem | I feel as if we can understand each other 
 Rem |" through the contact between
your hand and my hair. "
 Rem | I love your voice. 
 Rem | Just hearing you say one word 
 Rem | makes my heart feel warmer. 
 Rem | I love your eyes. 
 Rem | Normally, they look stern, 
 Rem | but when you're being kind to someone, 
 Rem | I love the way they soften. 
 Rem | I love your fingers. 
 Rem | For a boy, you have such lovely fingers. 
 Rem |" But when they clutch mine,
I know they are the strong, "
 Rem | slender fingers of a man. 
 Rem | I love the way you walk. 
 Rem | When we walk together, 
 Rem |" I love the way you occasionally turn,
to make sure I keep up. "
 Subaru Natsuki | Stop... 
 Rem | I love the way you look when you sleep. 
 Rem | You look unguarded, like an infant, 
 Rem | and your eyelashes are on the long side. 
 Rem | When I touch your cheek, you calm down... 
 Rem |" And when I playfully touch your
lips, you don't even notice... "
 Rem | And it makes my heart ache terribly. 
 Rem | I love you. 
 Subaru Natsuki | Why? 
 Rem | When you said that you hate yourself, 
 Rem | it made me want to tell you 
 Rem | all the wonderful things I know about you. 
 Subaru Natsuki | That was all phony. 
 Subaru Natsuki | You just don't know me! 
 Subaru Natsuki | I know myself better than anyone! 
 Rem | All you know is yourself! 
 Rem |" How much do you know about
the Subaru-kun that I see?! "
 Subaru Natsuki | Why... do you like me so much? 
 Subaru Natsuki | I'm... 
 Subaru Natsuki | I'm weak and small. 
 Subaru Natsuki | I'm running away. 
 Subaru Natsuki | Just like I ran away last time! 
 Subaru Natsuki | So why? 
 Rem | Because you are my hero, Subaru-kun! 
 Rem | In that dark forest, 
 Rem | when I didn't even know who I was anymore 
 Rem |" and couldn't think of anything
but violently lashing out, "
 Rem | you saved me. 
 Rem | When I woke up unable to move, 
 Rem |" and Sister was exhausted after
using too much magic, "
 Rem |" you faced the mabeasts as a diversion,
so we could escape. "
 Rem | There was no way you could win, 
 Rem | and your life was in real danger. 
 Rem | But you still stayed, 
 Rem | and came back to my arms, still warm. 
 Rem | When you woke up, you smiled, 
 Rem | and said the words I wanted to hear most, 
 Rem | when I wanted to hear them most, 
 Rem | from the one I wanted most to hear them from. 
 Rem | My time has been stopped for so long. 
 Rem | Ever since that fiery night, 
 Rem | the night I lost everything except my sister, 
 Rem | my time has been stopped... 
 Rem | It was you who melted my frozen heart, 
 Rem |" and kindly made my stopped
time begin to move forward again! "
 Rem | I'm sure you have no idea how you saved me, 
 Rem |" or how happy I was at that
moment, on that morning. "
 Rem | That's why I believe. 
 Rem | No matter what painful things happen, 
 Rem | even when it looks like you'll lose... 
 Rem | When no one else in the world believes in you, 
 Rem | when you don't even believe in yourself... 
 Rem | I will believe! 
 Rem | That the Subaru-kun who saved me 
 Rem | is a true hero. 
 Subaru Natsuki | No matter how hard I tried, 
 Subaru Natsuki | I couldn't save anyone... 
 Rem | I am here. 
 Rem | The Rem you saved is right here. 
 Subaru Natsuki | I've never done anything. I'm empty. 
 Subaru Natsuki | No one will even listen to me. 
 Rem | I am here. 
 Rem | I will listen to anything you have to say. 
 Rem | I want to. 
 Subaru Natsuki | No one expects anything of me. 
 Subaru Natsuki | No one believes in me. 
 Subaru Natsuki | I hate myself. 
 Rem | Well, I love you, Subaru-kun! 
 Subaru Natsuki | You really don't mind that it's me? 
 Rem | I want it to be you. 
 Rem | I would not want for it to be anyone else. 
 Rem | If you cannot forgive yourself 
 Rem | for being empty and having nothing, 
 Rem | then let us start from here, right now. 
 Subaru Natsuki | Start what? 
 Rem |" Just like you started my time for me
when it was stopped, "
 Rem |" we will make the time that
you feel is stopped for you "
 Rem | begin to move again. 
 Rem | Let us start here. 
 Rem | From square one. 
 Rem | No, 
 Rem | from zero! 
 Rem | If it is too hard for you to walk alone, 
 Rem | I will hold you up. 
 Rem |" As we walk, we will share the burden
and support each other. "
 Rem | Wasn't this what you said to me that morning? 
 Rem | Show me how awesome you can be, Subaru-kun. 
 Subaru Natsuki | Rem... 
 Rem | Yes? 
 Subaru Natsuki | I love Emilia. 
 Rem | Yes. 
 Subaru Natsuki | I want to see Emilia smile. 
 Subaru Natsuki | I want to be of help to Emilia's future. 
 Subaru Natsuki | Even if she says I'm in the way, 
 Subaru Natsuki | even if she tells me to stay away... 
 Subaru Natsuki | I want to be next to her. 
 Subaru Natsuki | Using my feelings for her as an excuse, 
 Subaru Natsuki | to get her to understand everything 
 Subaru Natsuki | was arrogant of me, huh? 
 Subaru Natsuki | It's okay if she doesn't understand. 
 Subaru Natsuki | I just want to save her. 
 Subaru Natsuki |" If there's a bleak,
painful future waiting for her, "
 Subaru Natsuki |" I want to take her away to a future
where we can all laugh together! "
 Subaru Natsuki | Will you help me? 
 Subaru Natsuki | I can't do anything alone. 
 Subaru Natsuki | I lack in everything. 
 Subaru Natsuki |" I'm not confident that I can
even keep walking straight. "
 Subaru Natsuki | I'm weak, fragile, and small. 
 Subaru Natsuki | So, to make sure I keep walking straight, 
 Subaru Natsuki | to help me realize when I'm wrong, 
 Subaru Natsuki | will you help me? 
 Rem | You are a cruel man, Subaru-kun. 
 Rem | You ask all this of someone you just rejected? 
 Subaru Natsuki |" Hey, it's also hard for me to ask
this of the one who rejected "
 Subaru Natsuki | my once-in-a-lifetime proposal. 
 Rem | I humbly accept. 
 Rem | If it will help you, 
 Rem | my hero, 
 Rem | greet the future with a smile, then yes. 
 Subaru Natsuki | Yeah, just watch. 
 Subaru Natsuki | You get a front row seat... 
 Subaru Natsuki | To see the man you fell for 
 Subaru Natsuki | become the most awesome hero ever! 
 Subaru Natsuki | I'm watching you. 
 Subaru Natsuki | You're watching me. 
 Subaru Natsuki | So I won't look downward. 
 Subaru Natsuki |" Natsuki Subaru's story will begin
right here, from zero. "
 Subaru Natsuki |" My life in another world
starts here, from zero! "
 Crusch Karsten | What? 
 Subaru Natsuki | Okay, I'll say it again. 
 Subaru Natsuki |" An alliance between the Emilia and
Crusch camps, on equal terms. "
 Subaru Natsuki |" For this purpose, I'll provide
the time and location of "
 Subaru Natsuki | the White Whale's next appearance. 
 Subaru Natsuki | That's the one card I can play. 
 Rem | The Witch's Cult? 
 Subaru Natsuki | Yeah, they're on the move and after Emilia. 
 Rem |" Roswaal-sama feared that
might happen, as well. "
 Subaru Natsuki | I want to stop them, 
 Subaru Natsuki | but I don't have the fighting strength. 
 Subaru Natsuki |" I have to start negotiating
now to pull some together. "
 Subaru Natsuki | Will you help me? 
 Wilhelm van Astrea | The White Whale? 
 Wilhelm van Astrea | Please forgive my indiscretion. 
 Wilhelm van Astrea | I suppose I still have much to learn. 
 Crusch Karsten |" And? It is rather sudden that you
would bring up the White Whale. "
 Subaru Natsuki | Not at all. 
 Subaru Natsuki | When we began this negotiation, 
 Subaru Natsuki |" I mentioned the magic stones found in
Roswaal's domain, in Elior Forest. "
 Subaru Natsuki | If sharing the mining rights is insufficient, 
 Subaru Natsuki | I need to offer something additional. 
 Subaru Natsuki |" Crusch-san, I'm certain that my
information will aid "
 Subaru Natsuki | in your plan to subjugate the White Whale. 
 Crusch Karsten | Let me ask one thing, Natsuki Subaru. 
 Crusch Karsten | What gave you that idea? 
 Crusch Karsten |" That remark was not one you might
pass off as a baseless accusation. "
 Subaru Natsuki | For these past few days, 
 Subaru Natsuki | some things have bothered me. 
 Subaru Natsuki |" First, the increase in traffic
to and from your mansion. "
 Subaru Natsuki | It's been just a bit excessive. 
 Subaru Natsuki |" Also, in the capital, I heard you've been
purchasing weapons and armor. "
 Subaru Natsuki | Plus... 
 Russell Fellow | If Crusch-sama's goal should be attained, 
 Russell Fellow |" I'm sure it would suit your
desires, Wilhelm-dono. "
 Subaru Natsuki | You appeared to be planning something big. 
 Subaru Natsuki | Of course, I can't prove it. 
 Subaru Natsuki | Maybe I only made the connection 
 Subaru Natsuki |" because I know the White Whale
will soon be appearing. "
 Crusch Karsten | I have another question, Natsuki Subaru. 
 Crusch Karsten |" On what grounds do you know
that the White Whale will appear? "
 Subaru Natsuki | This. 
 Crusch Karsten | What in the world is this? 
 Subaru Natsuki | The moment before that happened... 
 Subaru Natsuki | It's what you'd call a metia. 
 Subaru Natsuki |" It tells me when and where the
White Whale will appear. "
 Crusch Karsten | I find this a bit hard to believe... 
 Crusch Karsten | But I see that you are not lying. 
 Subaru Natsuki |" I appreciate that, but are you sure
you want to believe me so easily? "
 Felix Argyle | Lies will get you nyo where with Crusch-sama. 
 Felix Argyle | She has the divine protection of wind-reading! 
 Subaru Natsuki | Uh, say what? 
 Crusch Karsten |" When a person lies, a telling
wind blows around them. "
 Crusch Karsten | I can see that wind. 
 Crusch Karsten | You did not have that. 
 Subaru Natsuki | Does that mean you'll agree to an alliance 
 Subaru Natsuki |" in exchange for my information
on the White Whale? "
 Crusch Karsten |" You're getting ahead
of yourself, Natsuki Subaru. "
 Crusch Karsten | Whether I agree to it, 
 Crusch Karsten |" and whether I believe
you are separate matters. "
 Crusch Karsten | My decision will determine 
 Crusch Karsten |" the outcome of the royal selection,
if not the kingdom's very future. "
 Crusch Karsten | It cannot be made lightly. 
 Anastasia Hoshin | Mind if I listen in on this li'l chat, too? 
 Russell Fellow | Pardon us. 
 Crusch Karsten | Anastasia Hoshin... 
 Crusch Karsten | Russell Fellow? 
 Anastasia Hoshin |" Well, y'all asked us to
come, and here you are, "
 Anastasia Hoshin | startin' without us. 
 Anastasia Hoshin | That's hardly fair. 
 Anastasia Hoshin | Let us in on this. 
 Crusch Karsten |" Was it Natsuki Subaru who
asked you to come here? "
 Anastasia Hoshin |" Well, to be exact, it was this
gal he keeps with him. "
 Anastasia Hoshin | I only heard the gist, 
 Anastasia Hoshin |" but if you're really plannin' to subjugate
the White Whale, I look forward to it! "
 Anastasia Hoshin | For us business folk, 
 Anastasia Hoshin |" whether the White Whale's around
is a life-or-death matter. "
 Anastasia Hoshin | Of course, our mercenary team will help y'all. 
 Russell Fellow |" In addition to the White Whale,
I'm interested "
 Russell Fellow | in the concession that Natsuki-dono 
 Russell Fellow | proposed of mining rights to the magic stones. 
 Russell Fellow | If the alliance is formed, 
 Russell Fellow | magic stones from pristine veins 
 Russell Fellow |" will be distributed to the capital
through Crusch-sama. "
 Russell Fellow |" As the merchant guild's representative,
I cannot let the offer go unheard. "
 Crusch Karsten | Natsuki Subaru called you, as well? 
 Subaru Natsuki | I'll say it once more. 
 Subaru Natsuki | What I offer in return for the alliance is 
 Subaru Natsuki | a share in the magic stone mining rights 
 Subaru Natsuki |" and information on when and where
the White Whale will appear. "
 Subaru Natsuki |" In other words, the fuel needed
to subjugate the mabeast "
 Subaru Natsuki | that's terrorized the world for so long! 
 Subaru Natsuki |" If what I say makes no sense
to you, forget I said it. "
 Subaru Natsuki | But if your goal and my wish align, 
 Subaru Natsuki | then let's defeat the White Whale. 
 Subaru Natsuki | Let's go on a hunt! 
 Crusch Karsten | I still have several questions, 
 Crusch Karsten |" but it was brilliant of you
to expose my plans. "
 Subaru Natsuki | Then... 
 Crusch Karsten | I have questions, as well as doubts. 
 Crusch Karsten | Many things you say are unclear to me, 
 Crusch Karsten | so I have difficulty agreeing immediately. 
 Crusch Karsten | However... 
 Crusch Karsten | I shall choose to trust your eyes 
 Crusch Karsten |" and the spirit that led you
to create this situation. "
 Russell Fellow | Then the deal is struck. 
 Russell Fellow | There were a few touch-and-go moments, 
 Russell Fellow | but I'm glad it worked out, Natsuki-dono. 
 Russell Fellow |" I trust the promise we made prior
to the negotiation still stands. "
 Subaru Natsuki | Yeah, you were a big help, Russell-san. 
 Subaru Natsuki |" Once the subjugation is complete,
I'll give you the metia. "
 Crusch Karsten |" So you did lay some groundwork
before coming here. "
 Crusch Karsten |" And you were waiting outside the
door for your moment to enter? "
 Anastasia Hoshin | But it was up to us when we interrupted. 
 Anastasia Hoshin |" Well, as far as negotiations go,
I guess that just passes? "
 Subaru Natsuki | Took you long enough! 
 Subaru Natsuki | I thought you were never gonna enter! 
 Anastasia Hoshin |" When negotiatin', there's always
a time to make your move. "
 Anastasia Hoshin |" Well, as you're gettin' ready for
the subjugation and such, "
 Anastasia Hoshin | don't forget to patronize the Hoshin Company. 
 Crusch Karsten | You paved the way before negotiations began? 
 Crusch Karsten | You are surprisingly shrewd, Natsuki Subaru. 
 Subaru Natsuki |" My preparation and review
paid off, that's all. "
 Subaru Natsuki | To be honest, I couldn't be more relieved. 
 Felix Argyle | Well, that's plain to see. 
 Subaru Natsuki |" We managed to save face for staying
in the capital. Right, Rem? "
 Rem | Yes, you are truly wonderful, Subaru-kun. 
 Wilhelm van Astrea | Subaru-dono... 
 Wilhelm van Astrea | I thank you. 
 Subaru Natsuki | Huh? 
 Wilhelm van Astrea | I offer you gratitude 
 Wilhelm van Astrea |" equal to that which I offer to my
lady, Duchess Crusch Karsten. "
 Subaru Natsuki | E-Er, that's, um... 
 Wilhelm van Astrea | As perceptive as you are, 
 Wilhelm van Astrea |" I am sure you're aware, but if
I may introduce myself... "
 Wilhelm van Astrea | My family name is Astrea. 
 Wilhelm van Astrea |" I took the previous Master Swordsman,
Theresia van Astrea, as my wife, "
 Wilhelm van Astrea |" giving me the honor of the
bloodline's lowest seat. "
 Wilhelm van Astrea | That is who I, Wilhelm van Astrea, am. 
 Wilhelm van Astrea |" I thank you for so kindly
granting this old man "
 Wilhelm van Astrea |" the opportunity to slay the loathsome
mabeast that took my wife. "
 Subaru Natsuki | S-Sure! Of course I knew that! 
 Subaru Natsuki |" I figured Crusch-san would accept
my offer, keeping that in mind— "
 Crusch Karsten | Natsuki Subaru... 
 Crusch Karsten | The wind of untruth is blowing from you. 
 Subaru Natsuki | I get it... 
 Subaru Natsuki |" You bought all the dragon-drawn
carriages for this, "
 Subaru Natsuki |" so that's why I had trouble getting
one back to the mansion. "
 Felix Argyle | You're still awake? 
 Subaru Natsuki | As if I could sleep. 
 Subaru Natsuki | Everyone else is working through the night. 
 Felix Argyle | They have nyo choice. 
 Felix Argyle | We have little time. 
 Subaru Natsuki |" Yeah, the White Whale will
appear tomorrow night, "
 Subaru Natsuki | in the area around Flügel's Tree. 
 Felix Argyle |" So, given the travel time,
we'll just barely make it. "
 Felix Argyle |" Besides, can't you see it in
nyall their faces? "
 Felix Argyle | Nyot a single one is preparing unwillingly. 
 Felix Argyle | Everyone wants to be rid of the White Whale, 
 Felix Argyle | especially Old Man Wil. 
 Subaru Natsuki | He said it took his wife... 
 Felix Argyle | Yeah. 
 Felix Argyle |" He's been chasing after the
White Whale all this time. "
 Felix Argyle |" Ever since it killed the previous
Master Swordsman, his wife. "
 Subaru Natsuki | The previous Master Swordsman... 
 Felix Argyle | Well, now you know, 
 Felix Argyle | so you should stop worrying and get to sleep. 
 Felix Argyle | There's nyo thing you can do to help 
 Felix Argyle |" with supply distribution
or organization, anyway. "
 Subaru Natsuki | That may be true, 
 Subaru Natsuki | but you didn't have to say it! 
 Subaru Natsuki | I'm supposed to pick whichever one I want? 
 Felix Argyle | What is it nyow ? You don't like them? 
 Subaru Natsuki | It's not that! 
 Subaru Natsuki | I'm glad you're letting me borrow one, 
 Subaru Natsuki | but I can't tell anything about their quality! 
 Subaru Natsuki |" Do I look like a veteran who's studied
nothing but ground dragons for decades... "
 Subaru Natsuki | Are you that one from... 
 Subaru Natsuki | Looks like this is the one. 
 Rem | I am surprised. 
 Rem |" This ground dragon is a type
known for extreme pride. "
 Subaru Natsuki | Felis, I'll take this one. 
 Subaru Natsuki | It's love at first sight! 
 Felix Argyle | Sure thing. 
 Felix Argyle |" But don't say, ""Love at first sight."" "
 Felix Argyle | You're making Rem-chan pout. 
 Rem | I'm not pouting! 
 Rem | I'll be nice to it! I can do it! 
 Subaru Natsuki | Wha?! 
 Ricardo | My lady was tellin' me about you. 
 Ricardo |" You're the star of this
little show, aren't ya? "
 Subaru Natsuki |" That logo... And a Kararagi accent
from a demihuman... "
 Subaru Natsuki | Then, you're with Anastasia? 
 Ricardo | What, you knew? 
 Ricardo | I'm Ricardo, head of her mercenary team. 
 Ricardo | Nice to meet you, too, li'l lady! 
 Subaru Natsuki | Keep it down! Also, you're huge! 
 Subaru Natsuki | You'll snap my neck! 
 Ricardo | Hey! My lady! 
 Subaru Natsuki | Hey! 
 Subaru Natsuki | Ow... 
 Crusch Karsten |" So that is the pride of Anastasia and
the Hoshins, the Iron Fang... "
 Crusch Karsten | I see. They all look quite strong. 
 Crusch Karsten | Did you rest well last night? 
 Subaru Natsuki | I nearly died a second ago... 
 Subaru Natsuki | Oh, so I guess you're also fighting? 
 Crusch Karsten | You think I am capable 
 Crusch Karsten | of sitting in a chair, waiting for good news? 
 Crusch Karsten | I'm more surprised that you are participating. 
 Crusch Karsten | Can you fight? 
 Subaru Natsuki | Nope, I can't. 
 Subaru Natsuki | But even if I can't fight, 
 Subaru Natsuki |" I think this human will be pretty
useful against the White Whale. "
 Crusch Karsten | I must ask... On what grounds? 
 Subaru Natsuki | I'm not all that happy about it myself, 
 Subaru Natsuki |" but I seem to be the type of
guy who attracts mabeasts. "
 Crusch Karsten | What? 
 Rem | It is true. 
 Rem |" Thanks to that, Subaru-kun has
previously saved my life. "
 Subaru Natsuki | So, on my borrowed ground dragon, 
 Subaru Natsuki |" I'll run around under White Whale's
nose and draw its attention, "
 Subaru Natsuki | while you guys launch an all-out attack! 
 Subaru Natsuki | That's the tactic I'd recommend, anyway. 
 Crusch Karsten | Under the White Whale's... nose? 
 Crusch Karsten | Shockingly, I sense no lies in that statement. 
 Crusch Karsten | I never thought 
 Crusch Karsten |" I would doubt my divine protection as
often as I have in the past half day. "
 Crusch Karsten | They're here. 
 Conwood Melahau | Crusch-sama, we have arrived. 
 Conwood Melahau | Is this boy... 
 Crusch Karsten | Yes, he is. 
 Conwood Melahau | Thank you, young man. 
 Subaru Natsuki | Huh? 
 Conwood Melahau | Thanks to you, our wish may come true. 
 Conwood Melahau | We could not be happier. 
 Conwood Melahau | Thank you. 
 Rem |" It seems all of them have a history
with the White Whale. "
 Subaru Natsuki | Then, they're like Wilhelm-san? 
 Crusch Karsten |" Yes, many are men who have
retired from the front lines. "
 Crusch Karsten |" They have joined our subjugation
force at Wilhelm's invitation. "
 Crusch Karsten | Their morale and experience 
 Crusch Karsten |" is comparable to those of the
capital's active knights. "
 Felix Argyle | Crusch-sama, it's time. 
 Crusch Karsten | Right. 
 Crusch Karsten | Four hundred years. 
 Crusch Karsten |" Since the White Whale,
created by the Jealous Witch, "
 Crusch Karsten | made the world its hunting ground, 
 Crusch Karsten |" trampling the weak and dominating
the land as if it were its owner, "
 Crusch Karsten | four hundred years have passed. 
 Crusch Karsten | Countless lives have been lost in that time. 
 Crusch Karsten | Given its fog's unscrupulous nature, as well, 
 Crusch Karsten |" the number of graves we cannot even
inscribe with names will only rise. "
 Crusch Karsten | But those days of sitting idle end today! 
 Crusch Karsten | Today, those of us here will end it! 
 Crusch Karsten |" We shall strike down the White Whale,
and stop further tragedy! "
 Crusch Karsten |" We shall give the sorrow, which fell
short of true sorrow, "
 Crusch Karsten | a chance to shed overdue tears! 
 Crusch Karsten | We move out! 
 Crusch Karsten |" Our destination is Flügel's Tree,
on the Lifaus Highway. "
 Crusch Karsten |" Tonight, we shall slay the White
Whale with our own hands! "
 Mimi Pearlbaton | I'm Mimi! Glad to know ya! 
 Hetaro | My name's Hetaro. Nice to meet you. 
 Subaru Natsuki | Yep, nice to meet you. 
 Subaru Natsuki | Anyway, not that I doubted it, but... 
 Subaru Natsuki | You really are the second-in-command, huh? 
 Mimi Pearlbaton | Huh? Have we met somewhere before? 
 Mimi Pearlbaton | Hmm... I totally can't remember at all! 
 Hetaro |" C-Come on, Sister,
you have to sit up properly. "
 Mimi Pearlbaton | Totally can't... 
 Subaru Natsuki |" Don't worry about it...
Just talking to myself. "
 Subaru Natsuki | I'm Natsuki Subaru. 
 Subaru Natsuki | So you two are brother and sister, huh? 
 Hetaro | Yes, my big sister and I will do our— 
 Mimi Pearlbaton |" When Mimi and Hetaro are together,
we're the strongest! "
 Mimi Pearlbaton |" And the captain's also here,
so we're the super strongest! "
 Hetaro |" Uh, my sister and the
captain tend to be hasty, "
 Mimi Pearlbaton | Strongest! Strongest! Super strongest! 
 Hetaro | so I usually give the orders. 
 Subaru Natsuki | I see... 
 Subaru Natsuki | Must be rough... 
 Ricardo | What's the matter, bro? Ya look awful gloomy! 
 Subaru Natsuki | Whose fault is that? 
 Subaru Natsuki | A captain shouldn't make trouble for his men. 
 Ricardo | Hey, that's a nice ground dragon ya got there. 
 Subaru Natsuki | Hey! 
 Subaru Natsuki | Is it? 
 Subaru Natsuki |" I borrowed this one because
it seemed to like me, but... "
 Subaru Natsuki | Come to think of it, 
 Subaru Natsuki | the ones you guys ride look kinda different. 
 Ricardo | They're called rigers. 
 Ricardo | But ya don't see 'em too often in these parts. 
 Ricardo | They ain't as strong as ground dragons, 
 Ricardo | but they're much more agile. 
 Ricardo | If it comes to a brawl against the Whale, 
 Ricardo |" that's where they really
shine, so watch close. "
 Subaru Natsuki |" Shouldn't you have had ground
dragons pull the cargo, then? "
 Ricardo | We've gotta manage our luggage on our own. 
 Ricardo | If ya think the White Whale's our only enemy, 
 Ricardo | you'll get the rug pulled out from under ya. 
 Ricardo |" Ain't no guarantee we won't run into
thieves on the road, after all. "
 Subaru Natsuki |" If anyone's got the guts to take on
a fully armed group like this, "
 Subaru Natsuki | they wouldn't settle for being thieves. 
 Ricardo | Good point! 
 Rem |" It looks like Ricardo-sama is trying
to ease everyone's nerves. "
 Rem | Subaru-kun? 
 Subaru Natsuki | I thought I'd prepared myself for this... 
 Subaru Natsuki | You can tell the hero inside to awaken, 
 Subaru Natsuki | but it really isn't as easy as it sounds. 
 Subaru Natsuki | It's huge! 
 Rem | You sound happy, Subaru-kun. 
 Subaru Natsuki |" Oh, looks like people have carved
their names into the trunk. "
 Subaru Natsuki | We aren't on some field trip. 
 Subaru Natsuki | That's just bad manners... 
 Subaru Natsuki | Rem, get me a chisel! 
 Rem |" Even you should know that will
get you in trouble, Subaru-kun. "
 Rem | With me, for starters. 
 Rem | So the White Whale is coming here? 
 Rem | Honestly, I am opposed to 
 Rem |" using the witch's scent to draw
the White Whale here. "
 Rem | It's too dangerous. 
 Subaru Natsuki | I'll use whatever I can. 
 Subaru Natsuki |" If it gives us even a slightly better
chance of winning, it's worth it. "
 Subaru Natsuki | For a guy who lacks in every way, 
 Subaru Natsuki | I can only compensate with this method. 
 Rem | You are wonderful, Subaru-kun. 
 Rem |" That metia will tell you when
the White Whale is coming? "
 Subaru Natsuki | Yeah, I set it to make noise when it's time. 
 Subaru Natsuki | To be honest, without this— 
 Rem | That's a lie. 
 Subaru Natsuki | Wh-What are ya saying? 
 Subaru Natsuki | If it's a lie, then how am I gonna... 
 Rem |" You're speaking in something
like the Kararagi dialect. "
 Rem | It doesn't suit you at all. 
 Subaru Natsuki |" No, no, no! I mean, there's no
way I could be lying! "
 Crusch Karsten | Even Crusch-san said— 
 Rem | It's all right, Subaru-kun. 
 Rem | I can always tell when you're lying. 
 Rem |" I also know that you cannot
tell me why you do so. "
 Rem | So there is no need to convince me 
 Rem | or wrap everything in lies, 
 Rem |" or try to take the blame
on yourself like that. "
 Rem |" Because I have complete
faith in you, Subaru-kun. "
 Subaru Natsuki |" Man! Looking up at this huge tree
really fires you up, huh? "
 Rem | Yes, it does. 
 Subaru Natsuki |" If I don't look at it for a
long time, I won't relax! "
 Subaru Natsuki | I won't be able to look down for a while! 
 Rem | Yes, you're right. 
 Subaru Natsuki |" I should say ""thank you"" instead
of ""sorry"" right now, huh? "
 Rem | You're welcome. 
 Rem |" Besides, I am far more grateful
to you, Subaru-kun. "
 Rem | So we're even. 
 Subaru Natsuki | Uh... Wilhelm-san? 
 Subaru Natsuki | I heard a bit of the story from Felis. 
 Subaru Natsuki |" That you've been seeking revenge on the
Whale ever since it took your wife. "
 Wilhelm van Astrea | Please forget that. 
 Wilhelm van Astrea |" It was all time idly spent in
an old man's delusions. "
 Rem | You truly love your wife, do you not? 
 Wilhelm van Astrea | Yes, I love my wife. 
 Wilhelm van Astrea | More than anyone. 
 Wilhelm van Astrea | And no matter how much time passes. 
 Wilhelm van Astrea |" My wife was a woman who
loved to look at flowers. "
 Wilhelm van Astrea | She never wished to wield a sword, 
 Wilhelm van Astrea | but the sword loved her more than anyone. 
 Wilhelm van Astrea | With no choice but to live for the sword, 
 Wilhelm van Astrea | my wife accepted her fate. 
 Wilhelm van Astrea | When I married her, I took it from her, 
 Wilhelm van Astrea |" forcing her to abandon the title
of ""Master Swordsman."" "
 Wilhelm van Astrea | But the sword would not allow her to do that. 
 Wilhelm van Astrea | Subaru-dono, I thank you again. 
 Wilhelm van Astrea |" In this battle, I can find answers
in my own sword. "
 Wilhelm van Astrea |" And perhaps I shall finally be
able to visit my wife's grave. "
 Wilhelm van Astrea | At last, I can go and see her. 
 Subaru Natsuki |" Let's work together to beat the
hell out of that damn whale. "
 Subaru Natsuki | I'll help with everything I have, too. 
 Crusch Karsten | Only a short time remains. 
 Crusch Karsten | Troops, be on guard! 
 EXTRA | I don't see it... 
 Crusch Karsten | It isn't coming? 
 EXTRA | Is that... 
 Crusch Karsten | Troops— 
 Subaru Natsuki | Let him have it! 
 Rem | Al Huma! 
 Crusch Karsten | Troops! Follow those two fools! 
 Wilhelm ( Younger ) | I haven't seen you before. 
 Wilhelm ( Younger ) |" What is a woman doing here
so early in the morning? "
 Theresia van Astrea | Oh, don't worry about it. 
 Theresia van Astrea | Just come here. 
 Theresia van Astrea | Hey... 
 Theresia van Astrea | Do you like flowers? 
 Crusch Karsten | Troops— 
 Subaru Natsuki | Let him have it! 
 Rem | Al Huma! 
 Crusch Karsten | Troops! Follow those two fools! 
 Rem | They're firing the night-banisher. 
 Rem | Close your eyes. 
 Subaru Natsuki | Whoa... 
 Subaru Natsuki | It's just like everyone said! Incredible! 
 Subaru Natsuki | That's... the White Whale? 
 Subaru Natsuki | It's so huge. 
 Rem | Are you scared? 
 Subaru Natsuki | Yeah, I'm scared... 
 Subaru Natsuki | of the blindingly bright future, 
 Subaru Natsuki | where I'm praised for defeating it! 
 Subaru Natsuki | Now, let's run like hell! 
 Rem | Yes. 
 Subaru Natsuki | It's so fast! 
 Crusch Karsten | You greatly underestimate us, 
 Crusch Karsten | looking away so carelessly. 
 Rem |" The intangible sword,
without regard for range. "
 Rem | That is Crusch-sama's sword art, 
 Rem | famous for its Hundred-Man Strike. 
 Crusch Karsten | Disperse! 
 EXTRA | Disperse! 
 Wilhelm van Astrea | For fourteen years, 
 Wilhelm van Astrea | I have dreamed of nothing but this day. 
 Wilhelm van Astrea | Fall here, and leave your corpse behind. 
 Wilhelm van Astrea | You are naught but a monster! 
 Wilhelm van Astrea | How wonderfully cooperative of you, 
 Wilhelm van Astrea | coming here to be slain! 
 Subaru Natsuki | Oh, crap! 
 Ricardo | Don't you look away from us, moron! 
 Mimi Pearlbaton | Here, we go! 
 Hetaro | Everyone, now! 
 Crusch Karsten | Troops, get back! 
 Crusch Karsten | Fire at its flank! 
 EXTRA | Algoa! 
 Subaru Natsuki | Looks like that was pretty effective! 
 Subaru Natsuki | I think we can pull this off! 
 Rem | No, truthfully, 
 Rem | we had hoped that attack would ground it. 
 Subaru Natsuki | It's not losing altitude at all... 
 Ricardo |" We used all of our best attacks
right from the get-go. "
 Ricardo | If that didn't make it fall, 
 Ricardo | it's a lot tougher than we thought. 
 Subaru Natsuki | The magic attacks didn't work? 
 Rem |" Its white hair scatters mana
and disperses force. "
 Rem |" My magic was not as effective
as it appeared, either. "
 Crusch Karsten | Fire! 
 Ricardo | Time for the second campaign. 
 Ricardo | Hack away at its reserve power! 
 Subaru Natsuki | Acting as a decoy now would be a hindrance... 
 Subaru Natsuki |" So all we can do is watch
until it makes a move? "
 Felix Argyle | I feel just as irritated as you do. 
 Felix Argyle | I don't even have any attacks, 
 Felix Argyle | so all I can do is watch, anyway... 
 Subaru Natsuki |" But with your healing specialty,
you're our lifeline. "
 Subaru Natsuki | Just fulfill that role for us! 
 Subaru Natsuki | We're counting on you. 
 Felix Argyle |" You've really changed
in just one day, huh? "
 Felix Argyle | What happened? 
 Subaru Natsuki | If I had to say, 
 Subaru Natsuki | I've just become a slightly better man. 
 Rem | Wilhelm-sama is... 
 Ricardo | Upsy-daisy! 
 Wilhelm van Astrea | Miserable... 
 EXTRA | What is that? 
 EXTRA | Something's odd... 
 EXTRA | What's going on? 
 Subaru Natsuki | The color of its eye... 
 Theresia van Astrea | Have you grown to like flowers? 
 Wilhelm ( Younger ) | No, I hate them. 
 Theresia van Astrea | Why do you wield that sword? 
 Wilhelm ( Younger ) | Because this is all I have. 
 Subaru Natsuki | It disappeared? 
 Rem | We're going to move! Hang on! 
 Crusch Karsten | Troops, retreat! 
 EXTRA | Retreat! 
 EXTRA | Retreat! Re— 
 Subaru Natsuki | Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa! 
 Subaru Natsuki | That's what the magic fog looks like? 
 Subaru Natsuki | If that hits us... 
 Crusch Karsten | How many men did we lose? 
 Conwood Melahau | Twelve from my unit. 
 Conwood Melahau | We're three short now. 
 Crusch Karsten | Who was lost? 
 Conwood Melahau | I don't know. 
 EXTRA | Fourteen from mine. 
 EXTRA | One deserted. 
 EXTRA | I'm missing six. I'm sorry. 
 Otto Suwen |" No one was riding on the
opposite side from me. "
 Otto Suwen | Who is Rem? 
 Ram | Rem... Who is that? 
 Subaru Natsuki | You've forgotten Rem, too? 
 Subaru Natsuki | That's it... 
 Subaru Natsuki | People hit by the White Whale's fog 
 Subaru Natsuki |" vanish from existence, along with
any memories of them. "
 Subaru Natsuki | A Fog of Elimination. 
 Crusch Karsten | You're back? 
 Wilhelm van Astrea | Forgive my haste. 
 Wilhelm van Astrea | Damages? 
 Crusch Karsten | A total of twenty-one lost. 
 Crusch Karsten | It appears one whole platoon was wiped out. 
 Crusch Karsten | It won't even be possible 
 Crusch Karsten | to properly protect the honor of the lost. 
 Conwood Melahau | My apologies. 
 Theresia van Astrea | Why do you wield that sword? 
 Wilhelm ( Younger ) | Because I could not think 
 Wilhelm ( Younger ) | of any other way to protect. 
 Crusch Karsten | Now that it's in the fog, 
 Crusch Karsten | we won't know whence it will attack. 
 Crusch Karsten | Staying close is the worst thing we could do. 
 Crusch Karsten | Disperse immediately. 
 Crusch Karsten | What is that? 
 Subaru Natsuki | Is that the White Whale? 
 Subaru Natsuki | Hey! What's wrong? 
 Subaru Natsuki | Hey! 
 Subaru Natsuki | Hey! Rem! 
 Rem |" That voice is the fog, which is
directly attacking our minds... "
 Rem | Similar to mana sickness, 
 Rem | but much worse... 
 Subaru Natsuki | Some people can resist it, and some can't? 
 Subaru Natsuki | I don't feel anything... 
 Rem | It's all right. 
 Rem | It will calm down now. 
 Subaru Natsuki | Hey! 
 Subaru Natsuki | Enough... Stop it! 
 Crusch Karsten | Felis! 
 Crusch Karsten | Have the unaffected help them! 
 Subaru Natsuki |" They say hurting people is harder
on an army than killing them, "
 Subaru Natsuki | but what monster does that? 
 Felix Argyle | Move! 
 Subaru Natsuki |" I guess Felis can remove the effects
of the fog's contamination. "
 Subaru Natsuki | But there isn't enough time... 
 Subaru Natsuki | If it comes for us now, we're finished. 
 Subaru Natsuki | Crusch-san! 
 Subaru Natsuki | I'll buy us time. 
 Subaru Natsuki | Have everyone regroup! 
 Crusch Karsten | What? 
 Subaru Natsuki |" Rem, sorry, but I need you to accompany
me to the most dangerous place here! "
 Rem | Of course. Anywhere. 
 Crusch Karsten | Wait, Natsuki Subaru! 
 Crusch Karsten | In this fog... 
 Subaru Natsuki | Anyone who can't, stay where you are! 
 Subaru Natsuki | I'll Return by Death to— 
 Subaru Natsuki | I'm back... 
 Subaru Natsuki | Well, Rem? 
 Subaru Natsuki | Do I smell like the Witch? 
 Rem | Yes, you reek! 
 Subaru Natsuki |" That's what I wanted, but did
you have to say it that way? "
 Crusch Karsten |" Those who can move, get the injured
to the foot of the tree! "
 Crusch Karsten | We'll have to use a bit of force. 
 Subaru Natsuki | With the ulgarm, 
 Subaru Natsuki |" it was effective enough
to cover the whole forest. "
 Subaru Natsuki | What will it do this time? 
 Subaru Natsuki | Honestly, it's an unknown quantity... 
 Rem | No, it's working. 
 Subaru Natsuki | It's coming. 
 Subaru Natsuki | I-It's coming! 
 Rem | Ul Huma! 
 Subaru Natsuki | How? 
 Hetaro | Sis! Together! 
 Mimi Pearlbaton | Captain! 
 Ricardo | I got this! 
 Subaru Natsuki | Rem! 
 Wilhelm van Astrea | Looking away from me? How unfriendly. 
 Wilhelm van Astrea |" And after I have spent the past fourteen
years utterly mad for you! "
 Ricardo | This is startin' to get fun. 
 Ricardo |" It's more sturdy than expected,
but not all that strong! "
 Wilhelm van Astrea |" No, it's putting up less
of a fight than it should. "
 Wilhelm van Astrea | I find it hard to believe this mabeast 
 Wilhelm van Astrea |" got the better of my wife,
a Master Swordsman. "
 Wilhelm van Astrea | The fact that we got the jump on it, 
 Wilhelm van Astrea |" and that it didn't use its fog to
divide our forces to start with— "
 Wilhelm van Astrea | I'll take one more thing before I leave! 
 Subaru Natsuki | Wilhelm-san! 
 Wilhelm van Astrea | Be alert! 
 Wilhelm van Astrea | We don't know whence it will come. 
 Ricardo | What's up? 
 Ricardo | It ain't gonna follow? 
 Wilhelm van Astrea | It comes. 
 Subaru Natsuki | The fog's coming down! 
 Subaru Natsuki | Run! 
 Theresia van Astrea | Hey, have you grown to like flowers? 
 Theresia van Astrea | What is it? 
 Wilhelm ( Younger ) | There was talk of conferral, 
 Wilhelm ( Younger ) | and I became a knight. 
 Theresia van Astrea | Well, congratulations. 
 Theresia van Astrea | Then you're one step closer to your dream. 
 Wilhelm ( Younger ) | My dream? 
 Theresia van Astrea | Don't you wield a sword to protect? 
 Theresia van Astrea | A knight is someone who protects another. 
 Wilhelm ( Younger ) | I don't want... to die... 
 Wilhelm ( Younger ) | It's humiliating! 
 Theresia van Astrea | I see. 
 Wilhelm ( Younger ) | Were you laughing at me?! 
 Wilhelm ( Younger ) | Answer me, Theresia! 
 Wilhelm ( Younger ) | No... 
 Wilhelm ( Younger ) | Master Swordsman Theresia van Astrea! 
 Theresia van Astrea | I won't... come here again. 
 Wilhelm ( Younger ) | With a face like that, 
 Wilhelm ( Younger ) | you shouldn't be holding a sword! 
 Theresia van Astrea | I am the Master Swordsman. 
 Theresia van Astrea | I didn't understand the reason why, 
 Theresia van Astrea | but I do now. 
 Wilhelm ( Younger ) | The reason... 
 Wilhelm ( Younger ) | Wielding a sword to protect someone. 
 Theresia van Astrea | That sounds nice to me, too. 
 Wilhelm ( Younger ) | Wait, Theresia... 
 Wilhelm ( Younger ) | I will take your sword from you! 
 Wilhelm ( Younger ) |" I don't care about the role bestowed
upon the Master Swordsman! "
 Wilhelm ( Younger ) | Wielding a sword... 
 Wilhelm ( Younger ) |" The beauty of a steel blade...
Don't look down on them, "
 Wilhelm ( Younger ) | Master Swordsman! 
 Ricardo | We have trouble! 
 Subaru Natsuki | You're kidding me... 
 Mimi Pearlbaton | Captain? 
 EXTRA | How? 
 EXTRA | It's all over... 
 EXTRA | We're dead. 
 Subaru Natsuki | Don't let it swallow him! 
 Subaru Natsuki | If we extricate him before he's swallowed, 
 Subaru Natsuki | we can save him! 
 Rem | Subaru-kun... 
 Subaru Natsuki |" Don't think this little bit of despair
is enough to stop me! "
 Subaru Natsuki | Giving up doesn't suit us! 
 Subaru Natsuki | Not me, not you, 
 Subaru Natsuki | not anyone! 
 Subaru Natsuki | Let's go, Patrasche! 
 Subaru Natsuki | Run right under the Whale's nose! 
 Rem |" The only one who may sniff
Subaru-kun is me! "
 Crusch Karsten | Close your mouth! 
 Crusch Karsten | At a glance, the situation looks dismal. 
 Crusch Karsten | Where is Wilhelm? 
 Subaru Natsuki | If you remember him, 
 Subaru Natsuki | at least we know the fog hasn't erased him. 
 Subaru Natsuki | Everything depends on how well Rem fights. 
 Crusch Karsten | What do you think, Natsuki Subaru? 
 Crusch Karsten | Does nothing seem strange to you? 
 Subaru Natsuki | Strange? 
 Crusch Karsten | There are now three White Whales. 
 Crusch Karsten |" If it is actually a mabeast
that lives in groups, "
 Crusch Karsten | how could we not know that by now? 
 Crusch Karsten | There must be some trick behind it. 
 Subaru Natsuki | And we need to find out, huh? 
 Crusch Karsten | If not, we won't hold out long. 
 Crusch Karsten | We'll do something. 
 Crusch Karsten | Retreat is no longer an option. 
 Crusch Karsten | Fire! 
 Crusch Karsten |" ""Fire,"" I said! "
 Subaru Natsuki | Crusch-san! 
 Subaru Natsuki | Willpower! 
 Subaru Natsuki | Damn... Being a daredevil isn't enough! 
 Subaru Natsuki | I've gotta use my head! 
 Subaru Natsuki | Why are there three of them? 
 Crusch Karsten | Duck! 
 Subaru Natsuki | Whoa! 
 Subaru Natsuki | Awesome! 
 Hetaro | We'll all back up Natsuki-san and Crusch-san 
 Hetaro |" until the captain is fully healed,
and we can regroup. "
 Subaru Natsuki | Ricardo's still alive? 
 Hetaro | Yes, my sister took him to Felix-san. 
 Mimi Pearlbaton | He struggled a lot! It wasn't easy! 
 Subaru Natsuki | Gotcha... That's a relief. 
 Hetaro |" On the verge of death, our captain
sent a message. "
 Hetaro |" ""Hey, it's gettin' a lot lighter. "
 Hetaro |" The fact that I didn't die proves that!"" "
 Hetaro | That's what he said. 
 Subaru Natsuki |" ""Lighter""? "
 Subaru Natsuki |" What's light about a hard,
heavy situation like this? "
 Subaru Natsuki | Light? 
 Subaru Natsuki | That's it... I get it! 
 Mimi Pearlbaton | Huh? 
 Hetaro | Huh? 
 Subaru Natsuki | What? 
 Subaru Natsuki | Wilhelm-san! 
 Wilhelm van Astrea | Not skilled enough. 
 Wilhelm van Astrea | I was careless... 
 Hetaro | Is he all right? 
 Subaru Natsuki | Yeah, he's just unconscious! 
 Subaru Natsuki | Sorry, but could you take him to Felis? 
 Hetaro | Of course! What about you? 
 Subaru Natsuki | I realized something... 
 Crusch Karsten | It divided? 
 Subaru Natsuki | Yeah. 
 Subaru Natsuki | Its fighting strength and the left eye 
 Subaru Natsuki | that Wilhelm-san gouged out convinced me. 
 Subaru Natsuki |" Your group's been engaging it head-on,
so you must have sensed it. "
 Rem | I was absorbed in battle, but... 
 Rem | You're right. 
 Crusch Karsten |" I do agree with the conjecture that
that this one is weaker than the original body. "
 Crusch Karsten | But what good does knowing this do? 
 Crusch Karsten |" Killing three White Whales is
much easier said than done. "
 Subaru Natsuki | We don't need to kill all three of them. 
 Subaru Natsuki | Just one should be enough. 
 Subaru Natsuki |" That bastard's been making
its two doubles fight, "
 Subaru Natsuki | while it hangs around up there, watching. 
 Subaru Natsuki | What do you think it's doing? 
 Crusch Karsten | That is the real one? 
 Subaru Natsuki | It won't descend 
 Subaru Natsuki |" because it knows it can't
let itself be killed. "
 Crusch Karsten | But... 
 Crusch Karsten |" I cannot rely on my sword
to hit from this distance. "
 Crusch Karsten | If I had one strike, it might be possible... 
 Subaru Natsuki | I have a plan... 
 Subaru Natsuki | but it's a little too much of a wager. 
 Subaru Natsuki | You want in? 
 Crusch Karsten | I think you're insane. 
 Crusch Karsten |" We're already insane for taking on
that huge thing in the first place. "
 Crusch Karsten | Perhaps. 
 Crusch Karsten | No, you are correct. 
 Crusch Karsten | That goes for everyone here right now. 
 EXTRA | Get away! 
 Crusch Karsten | We will hold off the two doubles. 
 Crusch Karsten | I will take your wager. 
 EXTRA | They're coming this way... 
 EXTRA | Stay away! 
 EXTRA | Run! 
 EXTRA | We'll be wiped out... 
 EXTRA | Crusch-sama! 
 Crusch Karsten | Stand up! Lift your faces! 
 Crusch Karsten | Take up your weapons! 
 Crusch Karsten | Look at that boy. 
 Crusch Karsten | He's so weak and fragile, 
 Crusch Karsten |" a breath could blow him away,
and he's unarmed! "
 Crusch Karsten |" He is a powerless boy, whose defeat
I have seen with my own eyes! "
 Crusch Karsten | He's weaker than anyone else here! 
 Crusch Karsten | Yet he's shouting louder than anyone 
 Crusch Karsten | that we can still do this. 
 Crusch Karsten | So how can we sit here, with downcast gazes? 
 Crusch Karsten | If our weakest man has not given up, 
 Crusch Karsten | how is kneeling in defeat acceptable for us? 
 Crusch Karsten | Did you all come this far 
 Crusch Karsten | to wallow in shame?! 
 Crusch Karsten | Follow me! 
 Subaru Natsuki |" She has some nerve, calling me
a weakling and a loser... "
 Subaru Natsuki | Let's do this, Rem. 
 Subaru Natsuki | Time for the climax! 
 Rem | Right, Subaru-kun. 
 Rem | Al Huma! 
 Rem | Please! 
 Crusch Karsten | I'm counting on you. 
 Subaru Natsuki | Hey... Now that I see you up close, 
 Subaru Natsuki | you really are creepy. 
 Subaru Natsuki | Try to keep up with me. 
 Subaru Natsuki | Just so you know, I'm infamous for being 
 Subaru Natsuki | so annoying that no one can ignore me! 
 Subaru Natsuki | Okay, let's do this! 
 Subaru Natsuki | I'm doing you a huge favor! Listen up! 
 Subaru Natsuki | It's because of you, Rem died 
 Subaru Natsuki | and I experienced such a horrible trauma! 
 Subaru Natsuki | I made it back! 
 Subaru Natsuki | Rem! 
 Rem | Yes! 
 Subaru Natsuki | You saved me... 
 Rem | Thank you for the treat. 
 Subaru Natsuki | What are you talking about? 
 Subaru Natsuki | Don't let me down, Patrasche. 
 Subaru Natsuki | You're a dragon, aren't you? 
 Subaru Natsuki | Show me how awesome you are! 
 Subaru Natsuki | Take this! 
 Crusch Karsten | Fire! 
 Wilhelm van Astrea | This is for my wife, Theresia van Astrea. 
 Wilhelm ( Younger ) | I win. 
 Wilhelm ( Younger ) |" As a weaker swordsman, you no longer
have reason to hold a sword. "
 Theresia van Astrea | If I don't hold it, who will? 
 Wilhelm ( Younger ) |" I shall inherit your reason
for wielding the sword. "
 Wilhelm ( Younger ) | You need but 
 Wilhelm ( Younger ) | become my reason for wielding it. 
 Theresia van Astrea | Hey, do you like flowers? 
 Wilhelm ( Younger ) | I don't hate them anymore. 
 Theresia van Astrea | Why do you wield that sword? 
 Wilhelm ( Younger ) | To protect... 
 Wilhelm ( Younger ) | ...you. 
 Theresia van Astrea | Do you love me? 
 Wilhelm ( Younger ) | You know that. 
 Theresia van Astrea | I still want to hear you say it sometimes. 
 Wilhelm ( Younger ) | Very well. 
 Wilhelm ( Younger ) | Someday... 
 Wilhelm ( Younger ) | When I feel like it. 
 Wilhelm van Astrea | Sleep for all eternity. 
 Wilhelm van Astrea | It is finished, Theresia. 
 Wilhelm van Astrea | At last... 
 Wilhelm van Astrea | Theresia, I... 
 Wilhelm van Astrea | I... 
 Wilhelm van Astrea | I love you! 
 Crusch Karsten | The White Whale has fallen! 
 Crusch Karsten | The mabeast of fog, 
 Crusch Karsten |" which has terrorized the
world for four centuries, "
 Crusch Karsten | has been defeated by Wilhelm van Astrea! 
 Crusch Karsten | We have won this battle! 
 Crusch Karsten | Are you all right, Natsuki Subaru? 
 Subaru Natsuki | Somehow or another... 
 Subaru Natsuki | I'm glad you're also safe, Crusch-san. 
 Crusch Karsten | I am, yes. 
 Crusch Karsten | But our losses are not few. 
 Crusch Karsten | With the White Whale's defeat, 
 Crusch Karsten | those who have vanished will not return. 
 Subaru Natsuki | I think you did great, Crusch-san. 
 Subaru Natsuki | Your popularity should shoot through the— 
 Subaru Natsuki |" Wait, did I just give you a boost in the
royal selection that I shouldn't have? "
 Crusch Karsten | That is quite a gloomy look on your face. 
 Crusch Karsten |" You don't look like the hero who
brought down the White Whale. "
 Subaru Natsuki |" The first thing Emilia-tan's gonna
do is to call me a traitor... "
 Subaru Natsuki | What did you call me? 
 Crusch Karsten | The hero who brought down the White Whale. 
 Crusch Karsten | I would not wish to be 
 Crusch Karsten |" shameless enough to claim your
achievement as my own. "
 Subaru Natsuki | No, I really didn't do anything. 
 Subaru Natsuki |" It sounds like your opinion
of me has improved a lot. "
 Subaru Natsuki | I'm surprised. 
 Crusch Karsten | There is no cause for modesty. 
 Crusch Karsten | In truth, I would love to welcome you 
 Crusch Karsten |" into my household and reward
your accomplishments. "
 Subaru Natsuki | Please don't ask that of me! 
 Subaru Natsuki | It isn't about loyalty or allegiance, 
 Subaru Natsuki |" but my faith already lies exactly
where it should. "
 Subaru Natsuki | I'll make Emilia the ruler. 
 Subaru Natsuki | Not for anyone's sake. 
 Subaru Natsuki | It's simply what I want to do. 
 Crusch Karsten | I was already aware of that, 
 Crusch Karsten | but it still stings a bit. 
 Subaru Natsuki | Honestly, I think you're an amazing person. 
 Subaru Natsuki |" If I'd been on my own, I'm pretty sure
I'd have accepted your offer. "
 Subaru Natsuki |" I'll be counting on you to
uphold the alliance. "
 Subaru Natsuki | Even if we end up as enemies, 
 Subaru Natsuki | I believe we can get along until then. 
 Crusch Karsten |" Natsuki Subaru, allow me to
correct one idea you have. "
 Crusch Karsten |" Even if we do find ourselves
in conflict one day, "
 Crusch Karsten | I shall remain friendly toward you. 
 Crusch Karsten |" Even if the day comes upon which
we must settle things, "
 Crusch Karsten |" I shall not forget the debt
I have incurred this day. "
 Crusch Karsten | Therefore, even if we do become enemies, 
 Crusch Karsten |" I shall respect you and show
you favor until the end. "
 Subaru Natsuki |" If I hadn't already had a
#1 and #2 in my heart, "
 Subaru Natsuki | that would've been a close call. 
 Crusch Karsten |" I have not gone so far as to think
of you as a woman might. "
 Crusch Karsten |" I do not deny there were occasions on
which my heartstrings felt a pull, "
 Crusch Karsten | but my heart lies at the end of my dream. 
 Crusch Karsten | Now... 
 Crusch Karsten | I shall leave 
 Crusch Karsten |" to take our wounded and the White
Whale's carcass to the capital. "
 Crusch Karsten |" But it would appear you still
have a duty to attend to. "
 Subaru Natsuki | Yeah. 
 Subaru Natsuki | It may sound rude, 
 Subaru Natsuki |" but in a sense, that's what this
whale hunt was really about. "
 Crusch Karsten | Oh? 
 Crusch Karsten | Subjugating the White Whale was secondary? 
 Crusch Karsten | Intriguing. 
 Crusch Karsten | Do you require assistance? 
 Subaru Natsuki | I do. 
 Subaru Natsuki | But... 
 Subaru Natsuki |" Frankly, I didn't expect the hunt
would exact this kind of toll. "
 Subaru Natsuki | On top of that— 
 Wilhelm van Astrea |" In that case, why not
make use of this old man? "
 Wilhelm van Astrea | Natsuki Subaru-dono, 
 Wilhelm van Astrea | with this subjugation, 
 Wilhelm van Astrea |" it was because of you that
I was able to carry out my reason "
 Wilhelm van Astrea | for living all this time. 
 Wilhelm van Astrea | I thank you... 
 Wilhelm van Astrea | I thank you. 
 Wilhelm van Astrea | I thank you with all that I am! 
 Subaru Natsuki |" It was your strength that made
this possible, Wilhelm-san. "
 Subaru Natsuki |" The reason I thought to defeat the Whale,
and could fight without giving up... "
 Subaru Natsuki |" I don't know if it's okay
to say it like this, but... "
 Subaru Natsuki | Congratulations. 
 Subaru Natsuki | And thank you for your service. 
 Subaru Natsuki |" I believe you were able to do this because
you loved your wife like crazy. "
 Wilhelm van Astrea | I thank you... 
 Crusch Karsten |" You should hold on to that treasured
sword for a while. "
 Crusch Karsten |" In the days to come, being unarmed
will do you little good. "
 Wilhelm van Astrea | Yes, my lady. Thank you. 
 Crusch Karsten | Take Felis and half of the uninjured. 
 Crusch Karsten | They should number about twenty. 
 Subaru Natsuki | Are you sure? 
 Crusch Karsten |" I told you that I have
no wish to be shameless. "
 Crusch Karsten | And that I would respect you. 
 Subaru Natsuki | Thank you. 
 Rem | Why? 
 Felix Argyle | You cannyot move, right? 
 Felix Argyle |" As a user of healing magic, I cannot
let you push yourself further! "
 Felix Argyle | You'll stay behind— 
 Rem | But... 
 Subaru Natsuki | H-Hey, careful! 
 Subaru Natsuki | Please obey Felis, and don't overdo it. 
 Rem | I shall not. 
 Rem | It hurts too much... I cannot bear it. 
 Rem | When you're in trouble, 
 Rem | I want to be the first to reach out to you. 
 Rem | That is all I want! So please... 
 Subaru Natsuki | In that case, you don't have to worry. 
 Subaru Natsuki | You've already saved me so many times. 
 Subaru Natsuki |" Don't you realize how much you've
done for me up till now? "
 Subaru Natsuki | I want you to help me from now on, too. 
 Subaru Natsuki | So, this time, leave everything to me. 
 Rem | After this, you'll still keep me by your side? 
 Subaru Natsuki | I'm the one who should beg you for that. 
 Rem | I shall take that as a promise. 
 Rem | You cannot back out now. 
 Subaru Natsuki | It'll be okay, Rem. 
 Subaru Natsuki | I'll find a way to take care of everything! 
 Subaru Natsuki | I'm your hero! 
 Subaru Natsuki | I've decided to take that first step! 
 Subaru Natsuki | But you don't have to worry! 
 Subaru Natsuki | I managed to pull off the whale hunt. 
 Subaru Natsuki |" Right now, your hero
is fanatical like a demon. "
 Rem | Subaru-kun... 
 Rem | All right! 
 Rem | My hero is the greatest in the world! 
 Ricardo |" Man, you really got all the
good parts back there, y'know? "
 Mimi Pearlbaton | Captain... Mimi, too! Mimi, too! 
 Mimi Pearlbaton | I did super-duper good! 
 Subaru Natsuki | Didn't you almost die? 
 Subaru Natsuki | Also, your brother was exhausted. 
 Subaru Natsuki | How do you have so much energy? 
 Mimi Pearlbaton | Hetaro's just a baby. He's weak. 
 Mimi Pearlbaton | Really, it's so pathetic... 
 Ricardo |" Later in the battle with the Whale,
I didn't get much done, "
 Ricardo | but don't you worry. 
 Ricardo | My lady asked me for a favor, after all. 
 Ricardo |" In the real battle comin' up,
I'll show ya what I've got. "
 Subaru Natsuki | The real battle? 
 Subaru Natsuki | What're you trying to do here? 
 Ricardo | You're takin' on the Witch's Cult, right? 
 Ricardo |" Never underestimate the merchant
information network. "
 Ricardo | Ah, here they come. 
 Ricardo | That's half of our mercenary team. 
 Subaru Natsuki | Half? 
 Ricardo | Half of 'em were sent to block the road, 
 Ricardo | instead of fightin' the Whale. 
 Subaru Natsuki | They're going to help us, too? 
 Subaru Natsuki | Who's leading them? 
 Mimi Pearlbaton | My younger brother, Tivey! 
 Subaru Natsuki | You have another younger brother? 
 Subaru Natsuki |" I'm really curious to know if
he's more like you or Hetaro. "
 Mimi Pearlbaton | Hey! 
 Subaru Natsuki | Why is he with them? 
 Felix Argyle | Just now joining us, Julius? 
 Felix Argyle | Thanks for gracing us with your presence. 
 Julius Euclius | Please... You will ruin my reputation. 
 Julius Euclius |" But I am not the man called ""Julius."" "
 Julius Euclius | Let's see... 
 Julius Euclius |" Perhaps I shall go by ""Juli."" "
 Julius Euclius | Even if it is temporary, 
 Julius Euclius |" a man with a knight's status
must never lower himself "
 Julius Euclius | to the rank of mercenary. 
 Julius Euclius |" The man you see here is not
Julius Euclius, the knight, "
 Julius Euclius | but a simple wanderer called Juli. 
 Felix Argyle |" A proper household's code of
chivalry is a real pain, huh? "
 Subaru Natsuki | Bull... 
 Julius Euclius | It seems you're doing better than I expected. 
 Julius Euclius | How are you feeling? 
 Subaru Natsuki | Well, there were only some scratches! 
 Subaru Natsuki | A little spit fixed them right up! 
 Subaru Natsuki | What about you? 
 Subaru Natsuki | Been busy writing apologies 
 Subaru Natsuki | for fighting so seriously with an amateur? 
 Julius Euclius | I didn't mean that... 
 Julius Euclius |" I was talking about the damage to your
honor by the mabeast subjugation. "
 Julius Euclius |" But I'm glad your wounds from
before seem to have healed. "
 Subaru Natsuki |" Thanks to all of you, we succeeded
in defeating the White Whale. "
 Subaru Natsuki | But it's not over yet. 
 Subaru Natsuki |" I have to settle a score with the Witch's
Cult guys that picked a fight with me. "
 Subaru Natsuki | Once that's done, 
 Subaru Natsuki | the White Whale subjugation will be complete. 
 Mimi Pearlbaton | The Witch's Cult is next?! 
 Tivey |" Can we trust allegations that the White Whale
and the Witch's Cult are connected? "
 Tivey |" We only came as reinforcements for
the White Whale's subjugation— "
 Tivey | What was that for? 
 Mimi Pearlbaton | If you can't believe him, 
 Mimi Pearlbaton | then you just need to believe me! 
 Subaru Natsuki | I'd prefer it if you believed me, though. 
 Subaru Natsuki | I don't like to recall it, 
 Subaru Natsuki |" but I've run up against
the Witch's Cult before. "
 Subaru Natsuki | I learned it then. 
 Felix Argyle | Didn't you look into that, Old Man Wil? 
 Wilhelm van Astrea | I would not term it definitive evidence, 
 Wilhelm van Astrea |" but the distributions of Whale
appearances and Cult activities "
 Wilhelm van Astrea | coincided in several respects. 
 Subaru Natsuki | That makes it doubly credible! 
 Subaru Natsuki | On that note, 
 Subaru Natsuki |" we're going to head
for the Mathers domain. "
 Subaru Natsuki | The Witch's Cult is hiding in the forest there. 
 Subaru Natsuki |" The way we defeat them
is as simple as it gets. "
 Subaru Natsuki |" Raid them before they can
read our movements, "
 Subaru Natsuki | and crush them! 
 Conwood Melahau | Is there a way to protect the villagers? 
 Subaru Natsuki | I asked Anastasia-san and Russell-san 
 Subaru Natsuki | to talk to the merchants along the highway. 
 Subaru Natsuki |" Under the condition that Margrave Mathers
buys their cargo at asking prices, "
 Subaru Natsuki |" they'll ask the merchants
to evacuate the Arlam "
 Subaru Natsuki | villagers and Roswaal mansion residents. 
 Subaru Natsuki | And a messenger from Crusch-san's household 
 Subaru Natsuki |" is headed for the mansion
with a handwritten letter. "
 Subaru Natsuki | There will be chaos 
 Subaru Natsuki |" if we don't notify Emilia and the rest
about the alliance and such. "
 Ricardo | Sounds like we're all ready. 
 Tivey | Yeah! 
 Mimi Pearlbaton | Yeah! 
 Wilhelm van Astrea |" We have never enjoyed such an advantage
in a battle with the Witch's Cult. "
 Subaru Natsuki | Yeah. 
 Subaru Natsuki |" With Julius and his crew, we don't have
to worry about being outnumbered. "
 Julius Euclius | I would like to offer one correction. 
 Julius Euclius | My name is Juli. 
 Julius Euclius | Please take care to use it. 
 Subaru Natsuki | That'll just be a hassle in casual settings! 
 Subaru Natsuki |" The battle with the White Whale
was so tough, I thought I'd die. "
 Subaru Natsuki | Some of us did die. 
 Subaru Natsuki | Some others vanished, never to return. 
 Subaru Natsuki | Let's win the war without losing anyone here. 
 Subaru Natsuki | Let's all return home alive! 
 Julius Euclius | You really managed to win? 
 Subaru Natsuki | Huh? 
 Julius Euclius | The subjugation of the White Whale 
 Julius Euclius |" was a long-standing wish
of the Imperial Knights. "
 Julius Euclius | It seems I owe you my thanks. 
 Subaru Natsuki | You don't have to force it. 
 Julius Euclius |" For putting an end to a calamity that
all nations ignored for far too long, "
 Julius Euclius | I thank you. 
 Subaru Natsuki | I'm... 
 Subaru Natsuki | grateful to you, too. 
 Subaru Natsuki | For coming to back us up. 
 Subaru Natsuki | Even after what happened. 
 Subaru Natsuki | About that, I was... 
 Subaru Natsuki | Oh, damn it! Crap! 
 Subaru Natsuki | I know, okay? I know it now! 
 Subaru Natsuki | It was my fault. 
 Subaru Natsuki | Sorry. I... I apologize. 
 Julius Euclius | I apologize, as well. 
 Julius Euclius | I cannot take back my words and actions, 
 Julius Euclius |" but I apologize, from the bottom
of my heart, for belittling you. "
 Subaru Natsuki | I'm sorry, but... 
 Subaru Natsuki | I hate your guts. 
 Subaru Natsuki |" I feel bad for what happened,
and I'm grateful you're here. "
 Subaru Natsuki | But I hate your guts. 
 Subaru Natsuki |" Seriously, I hate you from
the bottom of my heart! "
 Julius Euclius | That is fine. 
 Julius Euclius |" I have no intention
of befriending you, either. "
 Subaru Natsuki |" All right, as I say every time,
let's get this fight started. "
 Subaru Natsuki | Fate, bring it on! 
 Puck | You must be exhausted, Lia. 
 Puck | You should rest a bit. 
 Emilia | No. 
 Emilia | I don't think I'll be able to fall asleep. 
 Emilia | What about you? Aren't you tired? 
 Puck | I'm fine. 
 Puck | The forest barrier is all fixed up, too. 
 Puck | You don't have to worry about anything! 
 Emilia | Yeah. 
 Emilia | But... 
 Subaru Natsuki | This feels like the time 
 Subaru Natsuki |" I found a cockroach in the
corner of a quiet room. "
 Subaru Natsuki | You were drawn to the smell, huh? 
 Subaru Natsuki | Perfect cockroach bait... 
 Subaru Natsuki | Do I really smell that bad? 
 Subaru Natsuki | Thanks for coming to meet me. 
 Subaru Natsuki | Sorry to say it when you just arrived, 
 Subaru Natsuki |" but I'll leave you to work the
details out for yourselves. "
 Subaru Natsuki | So don't get in my way. 
 Subaru Natsuki |" If they'd stuck around long enough
for me to order them "
 Subaru Natsuki |" to gather their stuff and go home,
this would've been easier... "
 Petelgeuse Romanee-Conti | I have been waiting for you, believer in love. 
 Petelgeuse Romanee-Conti |" In the Witch's Cult, I am a Sin Archbishop,
representing sloth, "
 Petelgeuse Romanee-Conti | Betelgeuse Romanée-Conti. 
 Petelgeuse Romanee-Conti |" I welcome you,
beloved child, blessed with love. "
 Petelgeuse Romanee-Conti | Wonderful! 
 Petelgeuse Romanee-Conti | Wonderful! 
 Subaru Natsuki | Hey. 
 Subaru Natsuki | I really appreciate the unexpected welcome. 
 Subaru Natsuki |" But I'm not sure I really feel this
""love"" you keep bringing up. "
 Petelgeuse Romanee-Conti | It always begins suddenly. 
 Petelgeuse Romanee-Conti | Everyone, on a certain day, 
 Petelgeuse Romanee-Conti | realizes that they are loved. 
 Petelgeuse Romanee-Conti | They feel the love! 
 Petelgeuse Romanee-Conti |" The love! The love! The love! The love!
The love! The love! The love! "
 Subaru Natsuki | Um, and what am I supposed to do now? 
 Petelgeuse Romanee-Conti | Ah, the witch's generous love... 
 Petelgeuse Romanee-Conti | You wouldn't happen to be Pride, would you? 
 Petelgeuse Romanee-Conti | Of the six Sin Archbishops, 
 Petelgeuse Romanee-Conti | only Pride's seat remains vacant... 
 Petelgeuse Romanee-Conti | You have 
 Petelgeuse Romanee-Conti | received the Gospel, haven't you? 
 Subaru Natsuki | The Gospel? 
 Petelgeuse Romanee-Conti | My brain 
 Petelgeuse Romanee-Conti | trembles! 
 Petelgeuse Romanee-Conti | Presentation of the Gospel, 
 Petelgeuse Romanee-Conti | proof of love... 
 Petelgeuse Romanee-Conti | Proof! Proof! Proof! Proof! 
 Petelgeuse Romanee-Conti | Huh? 
 Petelgeuse Romanee-Conti | My Gospel has no account of you. 
 Subaru Natsuki | That book is the Gospel? 
 Petelgeuse Romanee-Conti | Then why did you appear here? 
 Petelgeuse Romanee-Conti | Why visit here? 
 Petelgeuse Romanee-Conti | What fortune are you here to deliver?! 
 Subaru Natsuki | Oh! So that's the Gospel! 
 Subaru Natsuki | I see, I see... 
 Subaru Natsuki | I understand, I understand. 
 Subaru Natsuki | You should have just said so. 
 Subaru Natsuki | Aw, darn it! I'm sorry! 
 Petelgeuse Romanee-Conti | What? 
 Subaru Natsuki | My Gospel is, well, you know... 
 Subaru Natsuki | I used it as a coaster, and it got messy. 
 Subaru Natsuki | So I threw it out. 
 Petelgeuse Romanee-Conti | Proof of love! 
 Petelgeuse Romanee-Conti | Authority of Sloth... 
 Petelgeuse Romanee-Conti | Unseen Hand! 
 Petelgeuse Romanee-Conti | What? 
 Subaru Natsuki |" It's an ""unseen hand,"" right? "
 Subaru Natsuki | So if I can see it, I can evade it! 
 Petelgeuse Romanee-Conti | You can see my Unseen Hand?! 
 Subaru Natsuki | Okay, I'm just about done buying time! 
 Subaru Natsuki | Prepare to be buried alive! 
 Subaru Natsuki | Suffer, as you regret the things you've done! 
 Petelgeuse Romanee-Conti | How... How could this be? 
 Petelgeuse Romanee-Conti | My fingers, so cruelly, so mercilessly, 
 Petelgeuse Romanee-Conti |" so chaotically, so arbitrarily,
so artlessly, so meaninglessly... "
 Petelgeuse Romanee-Conti | My brain... My brain trembles! 
 Mimi Pearlbaton | Yikes, that guy's kinda scary. 
 Tivey |" I think all the Witch's Cult
members are like that. "
 Petelgeuse Romanee-Conti | Yes, of course... 
 Petelgeuse Romanee-Conti | Fine... Fine. 
 Petelgeuse Romanee-Conti |" I understand. Let's do this.
I'm ready to do this. "
 Petelgeuse Romanee-Conti |" The time has come to learn which
of us is worthy of her love! "
 Petelgeuse Romanee-Conti | Her love! Yes, her love! 
 Subaru Natsuki | Sorry to interrupt your fun, but... 
 Petelgeuse Romanee-Conti | —ove? 
 Subaru Natsuki | I have someone else lined up to take you on! 
 Subaru Natsuki | I-It's over... Right? 
 Felix Argyle | He's very much dead! 
 Felix Argyle |" The capital's most powerful
healer guarantees it. "
 Subaru Natsuki | I see... 
 Subaru Natsuki |" Wilhelm-san, I'm sorry to ask
such an unreasonable favor. "
 Wilhelm van Astrea | Was it unreasonable? 
 Subaru Natsuki |" Isn't cutting someone down
without warning, from behind, "
 Subaru Natsuki | the worst thing a knight can do? 
 Wilhelm van Astrea | Chivalry is long dead. 
 Wilhelm van Astrea | You need not concern yourself with that. 
 Tivey |" Hmm... Doesn't look like he's
carrying anything useful. "
 Subaru Natsuki |" You mini guys are ransacking his corpse
like it's the obvious thing to do... "
 Tivey | I'm not mini. I'm Tivey. 
 Tivey |" I think it's our right to search
out the spoils of battle. "
 Tivey | What is this? 
 Subaru Natsuki |" I think it's the book that Betelgeuse
called a ""Gospel."" "
 Tivey | Eep! This is a Gospel?! 
 Tivey | Oh, no! I touched it! 
 Subaru Natsuki | I can't read it... 
 Subaru Natsuki | Felis, can you read this? 
 Felix Argyle | Whoa, nyo way! Don't point that thing at me! 
 Felix Argyle |" And don't do something as stupid
as trying to read a Gospel! "
 Subaru Natsuki | Is it that dangerous? 
 Wilhelm van Astrea |" The Gospel is the proof that one
belongs to the Witch's Cult. "
 Wilhelm van Astrea | They're basically their sacred texts. 
 Subaru Natsuki | Sacred texts? 
 Felix Argyle |" Rumors say one is delivered to anyone
with the potential to join the cult. "
 Felix Argyle | And once a person gets it... Imagine that. 
 Felix Argyle |" They're nyow a devout member
of the Witch's Cult. "
 Subaru Natsuki | How shady can you get? 
 Subaru Natsuki | Well, I guess I'll take this with me. 
 Subaru Natsuki | If I can decipher it, 
 Subaru Natsuki |" maybe I can figure out what
the Witch's Cult really is. "
 Mimi Pearlbaton | Hey, hey, we've killed the enemy here, 
 Mimi Pearlbaton |" so shouldn't we go make sure the
other enemies are dead, too? "
 Subaru Natsuki | You know, as adorable as you look, 
 Subaru Natsuki | you say some pretty disturbing things... 
 Mimi Pearlbaton | Aw, I'm adorable? You're makin' me blush! 
 Wilhelm van Astrea |" Then the subordinates that Betelgeuse
called ""fingers"" number ten, in total? "
 Tivey | I think one of them is pinned under there. 
 Mimi Pearlbaton | Ten minus one is nine! 
 Mimi Pearlbaton | So nine are left! 
 Wilhelm van Astrea | Then, shall we go? 
 Subaru Natsuki | But they really are dead, right? 
 Subaru Natsuki |" They won't come back the second
we look away, right? "
 Mimi Pearlbaton |" Fine... If you're that
worried, we'll make sure. "
 Julius Euclius | We crushed two fingers here. 
 Julius Euclius |" A few of the cultists were skilled,
but they posed no threat. "
 Julius Euclius | Driving them off, we made no error. 
 Subaru Natsuki | I'm glad it went well for you guys, too... 
 Julius Euclius | Given your demeanor, 
 Julius Euclius |" evidently, I can assume your
news is good, as well? "
 Subaru Natsuki | Yep, we took out Betelgeuse! 
 Mimi Pearlbaton | And since this guy is such a worrywart, 
 Mimi Pearlbaton |" we blasted him to bits with one more
""kaboom"" after we killed him! "
 Mimi Pearlbaton | All to bits! 
 EXTRA |" Then, that leaves the simple task of
mopping up the remnants, huh? "
 Ricardo | We'd better hurry 
 Ricardo |" and take care of 'em before
my lady turns into an old granny... "
 Ricardo | Oh, that was my best joke, y'know! 
 Julius Euclius |" We rendezvous soon with the dragon-drawn
carriages you arranged. "
 Julius Euclius |" Let us eliminate the remaining fingers
and greet our victory together. "
 Felix Argyle | Okay, Subaru-kyun , time for the bait. 
 Felix Argyle | Put out that smell! 
 Felix Argyle | Breathe in... 
 Felix Argyle | And out... 
 Felix Argyle | And out... And out... And out... 
 Subaru Natsuki | Hey, hang on! Don't be crazy! 
 Subaru Natsuki | So I guess... 
 Subaru Natsuki | Once this is all done, 
 Subaru Natsuki | we'll go back to being friend and foe. 
 Julius Euclius |" How confident of you to worry
about what is yet to come. "
 Subaru Natsuki | Hey, sue me. 
 Subaru Natsuki |" It's going almost too well, so I
may have lowered my guard. "
 Subaru Natsuki | Get down! 
 Ricardo | What is this? 
 Ricardo | What's goin' on?! 
 Subaru Natsuki | The Unseen Hand... 
 Subaru Natsuki | Betelgeuse should be dead! 
 Subaru Natsuki | So who's— 
 Wilhelm van Astrea | Subaru-dono! 
 Subaru Natsuki | Damn it! 
 EXTRA | Ah! 
 EXTRA | My brain... trembles... 
 Subaru Natsuki | Who are you? 
 Subaru Natsuki | Wh-Who the hell are you? 
 Subaru Natsuki | Are you Betelgeuse's... 
 EXTRA | Finger, yes! 
 Subaru Natsuki | Let me go... 
 EXTRA | I am a finger, 
 EXTRA | one who reciprocates love. 
 EXTRA |" A faithful, diligent
disciple who will carry out "
 EXTRA | the Ordeal, following the guidance of love! 
 Subaru Natsuki | A copy? 
 Subaru Natsuki | A replica of... the original Betelgeuse? 
 Subaru Natsuki |" If so, this couldn't...
possibly get any worse. "
 EXTRA | Sniff, sniff. 
 EXTRA |" The love that hangs from you does not
compare to that of a mere follower. "
 EXTRA | It is equal to that of a Sin Archbishop. 
 EXTRA | It is exceedingly 
 EXTRA |" displeasing, dissatisfying, disagreeable,
discomforting, disproportionate, discordant! "
 EXTRA | But that is the proof that you are Pride! 
 Subaru Natsuki | Don't make me keep saying it... 
 Subaru Natsuki | I'm not even close to Pride. 
 Subaru Natsuki |" I've never gotten a free book,
even as a membership perk! "
 EXTRA | My! Are you being stubborn? 
 EXTRA | Still, soon enough, you will quite readily... 
 EXTRA | The Gospel... 
 EXTRA | The guidance of my love! 
 EXTRA |" The Gospel that allows me,
though inexperienced, to return love! "
 EXTRA | It isn't with me now! 
 EXTRA | Was it you? 
 EXTRA | You? You? You? You? You? You? You? You?! 
 EXTRA | Did you steal it?! 
 Subaru Natsuki | Wha... 
 EXTRA | A spirit? 
 EXTRA | A spirit! 
 EXTRA | Spirit! Spirit! Spirit! 
 Subaru Natsuki | Damn it. 
 EXTRA | Is that all you can do? 
 EXTRA | If so... 
 EXTRA | Be dismayed. Disappointed. Dejected. 
 EXTRA | Are you two slothful?! 
 EXTRA | My life is spilling out... 
 EXTRA | My blood is running dry. 
 EXTRA | My diligent pulse, my life's support, 
 EXTRA | is stopping... disappearing. 
 EXTRA | Ah, my brain... trembl— 
 Felix Argyle | The first Sloth we defeated was a double, 
 Felix Argyle | and this was the real one? 
 Julius Euclius | No, 
 Julius Euclius | this may not be a matter of which is real. 
 Wilhelm van Astrea |" You mean that there may be more
than one Sin Archbishop of Sloth? "
 Julius Euclius | Either that... 
 Julius Euclius |" Or all hundred followers,
including the fingers, "
 Julius Euclius | are the Sin Archbishop of Sloth. 
 Subaru Natsuki | I dragged you all into this. 
 Subaru Natsuki |" If I'd realized it sooner, I could
have avoided this. "
 Subaru Natsuki | I knew what kind of power it was, so I... 
 Wilhelm van Astrea | Subaru-dono... 
 Wilhelm van Astrea |" I am sure that many thoughts are running
through your mind right now. "
 Wilhelm van Astrea | And I am certain none are superficial. 
 Wilhelm van Astrea |" But while this may be inelegant
of me, I must say this. "
 Wilhelm van Astrea | Fight! 
 Wilhelm van Astrea | Even if you have regrets, 
 Wilhelm van Astrea | even if you have remorse, you must fight. 
 Wilhelm van Astrea |" If you have made the decision for
yourself to fight, to struggle, "
 Wilhelm van Astrea | then fight with all you have. 
 Wilhelm van Astrea |" Do not give up for one second,
one moment, or one instant. "
 Wilhelm van Astrea |" Cling greedily to the victory
you have within your sight. "
 Wilhelm van Astrea |" If you can still stand,
if your fingers still move, "
 Wilhelm van Astrea | if all your teeth have not broken. 
 Wilhelm van Astrea | Stand and fight. 
 Wilhelm van Astrea | You must fight. 
 Subaru Natsuki | You're telling me to get stronger? 
 Wilhelm van Astrea | No. 
 Wilhelm van Astrea | I am telling you to be strong. 
 Wilhelm van Astrea | Ready to go? 
 Subaru Natsuki | Yeah, let's go. 
 Subaru Natsuki | Lend me your wisdom and strength! 
 Subaru Natsuki |" We're gonna start evacuating
the mansion and village! "
 Subaru Natsuki | Don't waste a single second! 
 Subaru Natsuki | Right now, 
 Subaru Natsuki |" the Witch's Cult hasn't noticed yet
that the plain is wide open. "
 Subaru Natsuki | We can get Emilia and the others in carriages, 
 Subaru Natsuki | and get them to safety in plain sight. 
 Felix Argyle |" With Emilia-sama and the others safe,
we won't have to worry about them. "
 Felix Argyle |" So we can focus on
subjugating the Witch's Cult. "
 Felix Argyle |" Fighting isn't easy when you know
you have a weak point! "
 Subaru Natsuki | You're making my ears hurt... 
 Subaru Natsuki | But that's exactly right. 
 Felix Argyle | While I'm at it, let me say one more thing. 
 Felix Argyle |" Subaru-kyun , you should really
make up with Julius soon. "
 Subaru Natsuki | Soon? We already reconciled after our fight. 
 Subaru Natsuki | You didn't see? 
 Felix Argyle | That was just for starters, wasn't it? 
 Felix Argyle | You still subconsciously harbor resentment. 
 Felix Argyle | You can rely on Julius. 
 Felix Argyle |" But I admit he is a bit unapproachable
and incomprehensible. "
 Felix Argyle | Go on, hurry up. 
 Subaru Natsuki | Okay, fine! 
 Subaru Natsuki | Uh... 
 Subaru Natsuki |" So, hey, there's something
I wanted to say to you... "
 Subaru Natsuki | What the hell's going on? 
 Subaru Natsuki | Is this the Witch Cult's doing? 
 Subaru Natsuki | Hey! Anyone? 
 Subaru Natsuki | Is anyone there? 
 Subaru Natsuki | Answer me! 
 Subaru Natsuki | Wh-What is that intense smell? 
 Subaru Natsuki | P-Patrasche! 
 Subaru Natsuki | No... 
 Subaru Natsuki | A flower like this couldn't actually exist. 
 Subaru Natsuki | And Patrasche wouldn't just let me die... 
 Subaru Natsuki | Which means... This is an illusion. 
 Subaru Natsuki | It's all make-believe! 
 Subaru Natsuki | A lesser spirit? Did you come to help me? 
 Julius Euclius | Subaru! 
 Subaru Natsuki | It was you? 
 Julius Euclius | That spiteful tone means it's definitely you. 
 Julius Euclius | I cannot imagine my subconscious 
 Julius Euclius | creating such a realistic imitation of you. 
 Julius Euclius | This is a bewitching spell. 
 Julius Euclius | Only you and I have returned to normal. 
 Julius Euclius | How did you make it back? 
 Subaru Natsuki | I burned a flower in my illusion. 
 Julius Euclius | I see. 
 Julius Euclius |" Someone put a suggestion
on the flower's scent. "
 Subaru Natsuki | Hey, is that... 
 Julius Euclius | The glow of my little buds. 
 Julius Euclius |" I will teach everyone how to break
out of the bewitching spell. "
 Julius Euclius | In... Nes. 
 Mimi Pearlbaton | Hi-ho! Hi-ho! No one's here! Where am I?! 
 Wilhelm van Astrea |" I've strayed away... No,
we've been pulled apart! "
 Julius Euclius | Is his affinity too great? 
 Wilhelm van Astrea | This is bad! If I don't do something... 
 Julius Euclius |" I'm sorry. Take a deep breath
and endure it. "
 Ricardo |" No, this is awful! No matter how much
forest I destroy, nothin' changes! "
 Julius Euclius |" I cannot spare the energy to
fine-tune it just for you. "
 Felix Argyle |" For this to happen at a time
like this... Crusch-sama! "
 Julius Euclius | Bringing everyone back is our priority. 
 Wilhelm van Astrea | That will be quite enough. 
 Ram | Kill me. 
 Ram | I won't accept this disgrace. 
 Ram | And? What is the meaning of all this? 
 Ram | Barusu, you'll explain it to me, right? 
 Subaru Natsuki | That's what I'd like to ask you. 
 Subaru Natsuki | You're the one who attacked us first. 
 Subaru Natsuki | What were you thinking? 
 Ram |" You shouldn't have to
ask what I was thinking. "
 Ram | It's rich, coming from an ingrate like you. 
 Subaru Natsuki | Ingrate? 
 Ram | You are, aren't you? 
 Ram | After everything Roswaal-sama did for you... 
 Ram |" Once you're done with him, you'd rush
to wag your tail for another master. "
 Subaru Natsuki |" Hang on! I think you're
mixing up your stories! "
 Ram |" So this is what it means to bite
the hand that feeds you. "
 Subaru Natsuki | Listen to me... The handwritten letter! 
 Subaru Natsuki | I wrote you a letter about this! 
 Subaru Natsuki | Wasn't it delivered to the mansion? 
 Ram | Yes, I did get a letter from the capital, 
 Ram | but... 
 Ram |" It was quite amusing,
sending me a blank letter. "
 Subaru Natsuki | A blank letter? 
 Julius Euclius | To send a blank letter 
 Julius Euclius | is a metaphor that means you have 
 Julius Euclius | no intention of speaking to the recipient. 
 Julius Euclius |" It could easily be interpreted
as a declaration of war. "
 Subaru Natsuki | This is a huge misunderstanding! 
 Subaru Natsuki | Do I even look that clever to you? 
 Ram |" So this is what it means to bite
the hand that feeds you. "
 Subaru Natsuki | You're still saying that? 
 Ram | I can't say it enough. 
 Ram | But I get the gist now. 
 Ram | The blank letter was some kind of mistake, 
 Ram | and you are still Emilia-sama's dog. 
 Ram | Correct? 
 Subaru Natsuki | Not really, but... 
 Subaru Natsuki | Okay, sure. Dogs are like family, anyway. 
 Subaru Natsuki | I'm fine as a dog if I belong to Emilia. 
 Wilhelm van Astrea | Would you not say that standard is a bit low? 
 Subaru Natsuki | In any case, these guys are reinforcements. 
 Subaru Natsuki | They're friends. 
 Subaru Natsuki |" We pulled them together to
wipe out the Witch's Cult. "
 Subaru Natsuki | There's no time. 
 Subaru Natsuki | We need to start by evacuating the villagers. 
 Julius Euclius | Subaru, they seem rather uneasy. 
 Julius Euclius | Remember to be considerate. 
 Subaru Natsuki | Okay, attention! 
 Subaru Natsuki | I haven't seen you guys in a while. 
 Subaru Natsuki | How have you been? 
 Subaru Natsuki | Look, I know this is sudden, 
 Subaru Natsuki | but I need to ask you all a favor! 
 Subaru Natsuki |" It seems mabeasts are up to no
good in the nearby forest again. "
 Subaru Natsuki |" So I've brought some specialists
to exterminate them... "
 Subaru Natsuki | But while they're working, 
 Subaru Natsuki | I'd like you all to leave the village. 
 EXTRA | Don't try to fool us! 
 EXTRA |" You're trying to sound cheerful about this,
but the villagers are frightened! "
 EXTRA |" All along, we've been afraid the
Witch's Cult would try something! "
 EXTRA | The Witch's Cult? No one told me about that. 
 EXTRA | Hey, wait... 
 EXTRA | Seriously? 
 EXTRA | Why lie about that? 
 EXTRA | Maybe he's trying to hide something. 
 EXTRA | You don't deny it, then? 
 EXTRA | Then, it was true! 
 EXTRA |" Why would they bother a
remote village like this? "
 EXTRA | Why else? Because of that half-elf! 
 EXTRA |" Because this domain's lord is endorsing
that half-elf for ruler! "
 Subaru Natsuki | Why do you have to make it about that? 
 Subaru Natsuki | The half-elf thing... 
 Subaru Natsuki | Emilia has nothing to do with it! 
 EXTRA | She has everything to do with it! 
 EXTRA |" If you mess with a half-elf,
the Witch's Cult shows up. "
 EXTRA | Even the village children know that! 
 Subaru Natsuki | You guys seriously believe that? 
 Subaru Natsuki |" That it's the fault of the half-elf
in the mansion?! "
 Emilia | The village, huh? 
 Emilia | But it might cause trouble for you. 
 Subaru Natsuki | Does that mean I'm just being selfish again? 
 Felix Argyle |" ""Lift your head. Don't look down."" "
 Felix Argyle | That's what Crusch-sama would say. 
 Subaru Natsuki | You... 
 Felix Argyle | Do you think what you're doing is wrong? 
 Felix Argyle | If not, there's no reason to look down. 
 Felix Argyle | Or is it harder to lift your head here 
 Felix Argyle | than to throw a tantrum in the castle? 
 Subaru Natsuki | Now, listen... 
 Subaru Natsuki | You're right. 
 Subaru Natsuki | Compared to that, this is nothing! 
 Subaru Natsuki |" I understand your feelings and
concerns very well! "
 Subaru Natsuki | I won't tell you to try to change them now. 
 Subaru Natsuki | Obviously, you'll have your own opinions. 
 Subaru Natsuki | It hurts, but I understand. 
 Subaru Natsuki | But for now, please accept my request. 
 Subaru Natsuki | Please do as I say! 
 Subaru Natsuki | Staying in the village is dangerous. 
 Subaru Natsuki | That's the truth! 
 Ram | The words of my household's employee 
 Ram |" are those of our master,
Roswaal-sama, himself. "
 Subaru Natsuki | Ram... 
 Ram | Follow his instructions immediately. 
 Subaru Natsuki | You saved me back there. Thanks. 
 Subaru Natsuki | But... 
 Ram | What? 
 Subaru Natsuki |" Having you take my side so easily
is kind of a new feeling. "
 Subaru Natsuki | Does that mean you've acknowledged me? 
 EXTRA | Subaru! 
 Subaru Natsuki | Hey, Petra... What's up? 
 EXTRA |" U-Um, will the lady from the
mansion run away with us? "
 Subaru Natsuki | Huh? 
 EXTRA | She came to the village yesterday. 
 EXTRA | She told us 
 EXTRA | we should take refuge in the mansion because 
 EXTRA | it's dangerous here, just like you said. 
 EXTRA |" But no one in the village
would listen to her. "
 Subaru Natsuki | It's okay. 
 Subaru Natsuki | She wouldn't get mad or anything. 
 Subaru Natsuki | Anyway, you should hurry and run. 
 EXTRA | Okay! 
 Subaru Natsuki | What happened to Emilia after that? 
 Ram |" You should know that she isn't
so perceptive as to back down "
 Ram | the moment someone denies her. 
 Subaru Natsuki |" But I also know she's not the kind of girl
who wouldn't be hurt by mean words. "
 Ram |" She tried to convince the villagers
to leave, but they refused. "
 Ram | But she couldn't do nothing, 
 Ram | so she repaired the forest barrier. 
 Ram | She feared there might be a mabeast attack. 
 Subaru Natsuki |" In and of itself, that's not a
bad decision, but still... "
 Subaru Natsuki | Julius... 
 Subaru Natsuki | Come with me. 
 Subaru Natsuki |" I'm going to explain things to Emilia
and the loli in the mansion. "
 Subaru Natsuki | With you there, it'll be more convincing. 
 Subaru Natsuki |" Just take it as a sign of my repentance
for going nuts in the castle. "
 Julius Euclius | I see. Understood. 
 Julius Euclius |" If that will help the discussion
to go more smoothly, "
 Julius Euclius | do not hesitate to use me. 
 Subaru Natsuki | Also... 
 Subaru Natsuki |" You were the one who put a
spirit on me, weren't you? "
 Subaru Natsuki | Explain that. 
 Subaru Natsuki | I get that you're a spirit arts user. 
 Julius Euclius |" More precisely, I prefer to
be called a ""spirit knight."" "
 Julius Euclius | I do use the spirit arts, of course. 
 Julius Euclius |" But that has not prevented me
from training with the sword. "
 Subaru Natsuki |" And you were the one who set
the little red one on me? "
 Julius Euclius |" ""Set it on you"" is a harsh way to put it. "
 Julius Euclius |" I was only having her,
Ia, secretly protect you. "
 Subaru Natsuki |" By the way, what was that thing you
did when you broke the illusion? "
 Julius Euclius |" A high class of magic known as ""Nect."" "
 Julius Euclius |" It connects the gates
of all who are in range, "
 Julius Euclius | so they can communicate with each other. 
 Julius Euclius |" However, it appeared to work
a bit too well on you. "
 Subaru Natsuki | I thought I was about to lose myself. 
 Julius Euclius |" For the spirits to mistake
the tuning is unusual. "
 Julius Euclius |" You may have a strong affinity
with spirits, perhaps. "
 Subaru Natsuki |" Sadly, the only spirit I ever made
friends with was a gray cat. "
 Felix Argyle | Well? Did you patch things up with Julius? 
 Felix Argyle | Did it work out? 
 Subaru Natsuki | I'm taking that matter back with me, 
 Subaru Natsuki |" to mull over carefully before I
make an optimistic decision. "
 Subaru Natsuki | Come to the mansion with me. 
 Subaru Natsuki |" I'll need at least one person from
the Crusch camp with me, "
 Subaru Natsuki |" to smooth over the misunderstanding
with the letter. "
 Felix Argyle | I'll do that after I finish my work here. 
 Felix Argyle | Subaru-kyun , come help us, too. 
 Felix Argyle |" It's dangerous work
involving the Witch's Cult. "
 Felix Argyle |" The contract said he'd buy their
cargo at the asking price, "
 Felix Argyle | so we must thoroughly inspect the goods. 
 Subaru Natsuki | Huh? But that shouldn't be our job. 
 Subaru Natsuki | Isn't this more importa— 
 Felix Argyle | Oh, come on! 
 EXTRA |" Hey, hey... No lovers' quarrels
in my carriage! "
 Felix Argyle | Hee-hee! You got in trouble, Subaru-kyun ! 
 Felix Argyle | Really, what a troublemaker! 
 Felix Argyle | There. He lowered his guard. 
 Felix Argyle | This guy's one of the Witch's Cult. 
 Felix Argyle | I touched him earlier to confirm it. 
 Felix Argyle | A weird spell is implanted in him, 
 Felix Argyle |" just like the ""fingers""
of the Sin Archbishops. "
 Subaru Natsuki | One was among the merchants? 
 Felix Argyle |" That's why I stole into his carriage,
to get under his guard. "
 Felix Argyle |" Now, tell us all the details concerning
what you're plotting. "
 Felix Argyle | My hands are the gentlest in the world, 
 Felix Argyle | but they can do some nasty things, too. 
 EXTRA | That's... 
 Felix Argyle | What? 
 EXTRA | ...right. 
 Felix Argyle | Ia! 
 EXTRA | And now, it's the beginning 
 Felix Argyle | Protect him! 
 EXTRA | of the end! 
 Felix Argyle | Thank goodness... You're awake. 
 Subaru Natsuki | Why are... you dressed like that? 
 Felix Argyle | I had no choice. 
 Felix Argyle | I can't reproduce clothes with healing magic. 
 Julius Euclius | Regardless, given the situation, 
 Julius Euclius | I'm glad you and Felis are all right. 
 EXTRA | Run 'em off! Don't back down! 
 Subaru Natsuki | How did they get into the village? 
 Felix Argyle | They stowed away in the carriages. 
 Felix Argyle | There was a finger among the merchants, 
 Felix Argyle | and we didn't take care of him. 
 Felix Argyle | I failed. 
 Julius Euclius | This is not the time for regrets. 
 Julius Euclius |" We had Tivey and Madame Ram evacuate
to the mansion with the injured. "
 Julius Euclius | Felis, join them and heal who you can. 
 Felix Argyle | Got it. 
 Subaru Natsuki |" Okay, let's crush all the
fingers that are left! "
 EXTRA | To think, to think, to think, to think! 
 EXTRA | That you would resist us this much! 
 EXTRA |" Such tenacity, clinging to this
ever-increasing love... "
 EXTRA |" As a diligent disciple, I cannot
begin to express my respect. "
 EXTRA | Ah! My brain trembles! 
 Wilhelm van Astrea | You're mine. 
 EXTRA |" In battle, if one focuses on what
the unseen arm does, "
 EXTRA | one will fail to see what is visible. 
 EXTRA | That is sloth, yes? 
 EXTRA | Yes. 
 Julius Euclius | He self-destructed. 
 Subaru Natsuki | Wilhelm-san! 
 Subaru Natsuki | We can't leave you like this. 
 Subaru Natsuki | We've gotta get you to Felis! 
 EXTRA | Why? 
 EXTRA | Why? Why? Why? Why? Why? Why?! 
 EXTRA | Why are you still alive? 
 EXTRA | After the attack you just endured... Why?! 
 EXTRA | Why do you not bend to my diligence?! 
 Subaru Natsuki | At a time like this... And they keep coming! 
 Subaru Natsuki | Hey, look here! 
 Subaru Natsuki | This is what you're looking for, right? 
 Subaru Natsuki | It's a gift from your precious witch. 
 EXTRA | You thief! 
 EXTRA | You really did have it! 
 Subaru Natsuki | Quit shouting... 
 Subaru Natsuki | If you keep yelling at me like that, 
 Subaru Natsuki | it'll make my brain tremble. 
 EXTRA | You must 
 EXTRA | die! 
 Subaru Natsuki | Julius, we'll handle things here. 
 Subaru Natsuki | You take care of your end! 
 Subaru Natsuki | And take care of Wilhelm-san! 
 Julius Euclius | That is quite a vague order, 
 Julius Euclius | but very well. 
 Subaru Natsuki | Julius... 
 Subaru Natsuki | Actually, it can wait! 
 EXTRA | Wait! Wait! Wait! Wait! Wait! Wait! Wait! 
 EXTRA | Wait, right there... 
 EXTRA | You cowardly, foolish, insolent, little man! 
 EXTRA | No matter where you try to run, it's futile. 
 EXTRA |" What do you expect to find at
wherever you're running to? "
 EXTRA | At long last, it would seem the end has come! 
 Subaru Natsuki | Do you 
 Subaru Natsuki | know what this is? 
 Subaru Natsuki | It's a magic stone for creating barriers. 
 Subaru Natsuki |" They were stashed in trees
throughout the forest. "
 Subaru Natsuki | You didn't notice? 
 EXTRA | What are you talking about? 
 Subaru Natsuki | This area is a mabeast breeding ground, 
 Subaru Natsuki | and we're a prime feast for them. 
 Subaru Natsuki |" At least, if you don't have one
of Emilia's barrier stones! "
 Subaru Natsuki | Only one finger left now. 
 Subaru Natsuki | Once we get rid of that one... 
 Subaru Natsuki | Damn... We have to hurry... 
 EXTRA | Ah! 
 EXTRA | Ah! 
 EXTRA | Ah! My brain trembles! 
 Subaru Natsuki | Sloth! 
 Emilia | That's enough, villain. 
 Subaru Natsuki | Emilia... 
 Emilia | Stand down, villain. 
 Emilia | I won't allow you to do such wicked things! 
 EXTRA | A-Ah... Ah! How grand! 
 EXTRA | What a grand day! What a lucky day! 
 EXTRA | What a grand destiny! 
 Subaru Natsuki | Emilia! 
 Felix Argyle | Wait! 
 Subaru Natsuki | I... I can't wait around now! 
 Subaru Natsuki | You want to make Emilia fight him?! 
 Felix Argyle | Calm down. 
 Felix Argyle | Have a little faith in her. 
 Felix Argyle | The people you want to protect 
 Felix Argyle | are not just those behind you. 
 EXTRA | Oh, my witch! 
 EXTRA | My witch! My love's guide! 
 Puck |" I don't blame you for being charmed
by my beloved daughter, "
 Puck |" but I won't allow any
unwanted pests around her! "
 EXTRA | Naïve! 
 EXTRA |" Naïve! Naïve! Naïve! Naïve!
Naïve, naïve, naïve, naïve, naïve, naïve! "
 EXTRA | This is love's true ending... 
 EXTRA | The fruit of my love. 
 EXTRA | Proof that the witch has returned my love! 
 Puck | That proof doesn't exist. 
 Puck | Your crush is purely one-sided. 
 EXTRA | Yes! 
 EXTRA | Ah, this is true... true diligence. 
 Emilia | Thank you for being defeated. 
 Felix Argyle | See? Didn't I tell you? 
 Julius Euclius | We've now eliminated all the fingers. 
 Julius Euclius | Victory is ours. 
 Subaru Natsuki | It's finally over... 
 Felix Argyle | Go see her. 
 Subaru Natsuki | R-Right... 
 Felix Argyle | Subaru-kyun ? 
 Subaru Natsuki | I have to get away. 
 Subaru Natsuki | From Emilia... From everyone... 
 Felix Argyle | Subaru-kyun , where are you going? 
 Subaru Natsuki | Stay away! 
 Subaru Natsuki | I'm... 
 Julius Euclius | Subaru... 
 Subaru Natsuki | Julius, stay away from— 
 Subaru Natsuki | You're too late. 
 Julius Euclius |" The moment Ia was flung from his
body, I had a bad feeling... "
 Felix Argyle | What do you mean? 
 Julius Euclius | That 
 Julius Euclius | isn't Subaru. 
 Subaru Natsuki | That's right. 
 Subaru Natsuki |" I am a Sin Archbishop of the Witch's
Cult, representing Sloth... "
 Subaru Natsuki | Betelgeuse Romanée-Conti! 
 Subaru Natsuki | Fantastic! 
 Subaru Natsuki | What a fantastic body this is! 
 Subaru Natsuki |" It's been decades since I had
a body that fit me so well! "
 Julius Euclius | You madman! 
 Julius Euclius | Get out of that body right now! 
 Subaru Natsuki | Madman? 
 Subaru Natsuki | That's right. I am driven mad with love. 
 Subaru Natsuki | Generous love, respectful love, pure love, 
 Subaru Natsuki |" tender love, familial love,
erotic love, friendly love! "
 Subaru Natsuki | Love, love, love... Love! Love! Love! Love! 
 Subaru Natsuki | Love! 
 Julius Euclius | Subaru! Wake up! 
 Subaru Natsuki | It's no use. 
 Subaru Natsuki |" This body is already under
my subconscious control. "
 Julius Euclius | Realize what you're about to do, Subaru... 
 Julius Euclius | Remember what you returned here to do! 
 Subaru Natsuki | What? 
 Subaru Natsuki |" Don't ""what"" me... You moron! "
 Subaru Natsuki | I am Betelgeuse Romanée-Conti... 
 Subaru Natsuki | This body has already become my finger. 
 Subaru Natsuki | Shut up! I'm Natsuki Subaru! 
 Subaru Natsuki | Kill me, Julius. 
 Subaru Natsuki | Use your sword... 
 Julius Euclius | What are you saying, Subaru? 
 Subaru Natsuki | If you don't stop me now, we can't win. 
 Subaru Natsuki | Before that happens... 
 Julius Euclius | No, Subaru! I cannot do that! 
 Julius Euclius |" You told me, ""It can wait."" "
 Julius Euclius |" Wasn't there something
you meant to tell me? "
 Subaru Natsuki |" Sorry... It looks like
I won't get the chance. "
 Subaru Natsuki | Felis! 
 Subaru Natsuki | Please. 
 Felix Argyle | You can resent me for this, Subaru-kun. 
 Felix Argyle | I will, too. 
 Julius Euclius | Felis! 
 Felix Argyle | No one else can do it, can they? 
 Felix Argyle | This is what Subaru-kyun wants! 
 Julius Euclius | But still... 
 Felix Argyle |" You think I did that
because I wanted to? "
 Felix Argyle | To use my power for Crusch-sama, 
 Felix Argyle | the power I swore to our leader, for this?! 
 Subaru Natsuki | Ah, it can't be, it can't be... 
 Subaru Natsuki | Just when I'd found such a perfect vessel... 
 Julius Euclius |" My lack of virtue was what forced this
undesirable decision on you and Felis. "
 Subaru Natsuki |" Just when the Ordeal's completion
was at hand... "
 Julius Euclius | One day, I'm sure I will be punished. 
 Subaru Natsuki | I will never die... 
 Ricardo | Boy? 
 Subaru Natsuki | This can't be... 
 Ricardo | What's wrong? 
 Felix Argyle | You were spaced out, so I had to pick on you. 
 Felix Argyle | Nyow that was a satisfying reaction! 
 Subaru Natsuki | Felis? 
 Felix Argyle | Who else do I look like? 
 Felix Argyle |" Did you inhale too much of
the White Whale's fog? "
 Subaru Natsuki | Uh, no... I'm fine. 
 Subaru Natsuki | That told me what I wanted to know. 
 Subaru Natsuki | That means... 
 Subaru Natsuki | My save point was updated? 
 Subaru Natsuki | There are a few new things 
 Subaru Natsuki | I've realized about the Witch's Cult. 
 Subaru Natsuki | Does anyone know of, like... 
 Subaru Natsuki |" a power you can use to overwrite
someone's consciousness, "
 Subaru Natsuki | so you psychologically possess them? 
 Julius Euclius | In other words, 
 Julius Euclius |" you think the Sin Archbishops
may have such an ability? "
 Subaru Natsuki |" Yeah, I call it ""possession."" "
 Subaru Natsuki | It's how he stays alive. 
 Subaru Natsuki |" It would explain how he keeps
popping up everywhere, right? "
 Julius Euclius |" In an old book, I saw a research
account of a similar subject. "
 Julius Euclius | It's a magic that has been lost, 
 Julius Euclius |" but the technique only works
under certain conditions. "
 Subaru Natsuki | Conditions? 
 Julius Euclius | Only members of the Witch's Cult, 
 Julius Euclius | and only a limited number of those, 
 Julius Euclius | are thought capable of it. 
 Felix Argyle | And those would be the fingers? 
 Julius Euclius | Most likely, they are the user's spare bodies. 
 Julius Euclius | It's quite a tasteless arrangement. 
 Julius Euclius |" I suppose one might call it
worthy of a Sin Archbishop. "
 Subaru Natsuki | So if the Sin Archbishop's confidants, 
 Subaru Natsuki | the fingers, were wiped out... 
 Julius Euclius | If that happened, 
 Julius Euclius | his soul would have nowhere to go. 
 Julius Euclius | And that would be the end of him. 
 Julius Euclius |" We should first eliminate the
fingers in the forest, "
 Julius Euclius | and then face Sloth directly. 
 Julius Euclius | That is my conclusion. 
 Subaru Natsuki | Guys, I need to say one more thing... 
 Subaru Natsuki |" Sorry, but I don't think
it's only the fingers. "
 Subaru Natsuki | I think he may be able to possess me, too... 
 Subaru Natsuki | What do you think I should do? 
 Ricardo | Huh? 
 Bordeaux | Filthy woman! 
 Priscilla Barielle | Then, will you also apologize for being born? 
 Priscilla Barielle | You silver-haired half-elf. 
 Priscilla Barielle |" Margrave Mathers endorses
a half-devil? Utter foolishness! "
 Rickert | This is a joke! 
 Emilia | You know, I had hopes for you. 
 Bordeaux | Filthy woman! 
 Emilia | I thought maybe you... 
 Emilia |" That only you wouldn't give
me special treatment. "
 Subaru Natsuki | I can't do that. 
 Subaru Natsuki | I can't look at you the way I look at others. 
 Subaru Natsuki | It's impossible. 
 Emilia | I have no connection to the witch... 
 Priscilla Barielle | You silver-haired half-elf. 
 Bordeaux | Margrave Mathers endorses a half-devil? 
 Puck | Lia... 
 Puck | Your forehead is all wrinkled. 
 Emilia | Good morning, Puck. 
 Emilia | You're early today. 
 Puck | Morning, Lia. 
 Puck |" I thought I'd try going to sleep
and waking up earlier. "
 Puck | That's a lie. 
 Puck | The truth is that I was worried about you. 
 Puck | You've had it rough lately. 
 Puck | Especially yesterday... 
 Emilia | It was nothing I didn't know already. 
 Puck | Even if you know you'll fall, 
 Puck | when it happens, you still hurt and bleed. 
 Emilia | What do you think I should do, Puck? 
 Emilia | No, not just me... 
 Emilia |" How can I be better to everyone,
and have them be better to me? "
 Puck | I think you should do what you want. 
 Puck | I'll be on your side, no matter what you do. 
 Puck | And no matter what, 
 Puck | you can't abandon that village, right? 
 Puck |" Early this morning,
Ram headed out there again. "
 Puck | Maybe we should wait to hear from her. 
 Puck | I'm going to check on Betty. 
 Emilia | Oh... Okay. 
 Emilia | Tell her hello for me. 
 Emilia | Ram? 
 Ram | Emilia-sama, you have a visitor. 
 Emilia | You are... 
 Emilia | from Crusch-sama's household, aren't you? 
 Wilhelm van Astrea | I am Wilhelm Trias. 
 Wilhelm van Astrea | I have come on my master's behalf. 
 Emilia | On Crusch-sama's behalf? 
 Emilia |" I received a blank letter
from her yesterday... "
 Wilhelm van Astrea | I see, so it was true. 
 Wilhelm van Astrea | While this shames me to say, 
 Wilhelm van Astrea |" the letter contradicted the message
my master wished to send. "
 Emilia | Oh... It was a mistake, then? 
 Wilhelm van Astrea | Yes, Emilia-sama and Ram-dono... 
 Wilhelm van Astrea | We would like to evacuate those remaining 
 Wilhelm van Astrea | in the mansion, along with the villagers. 
 Wilhelm van Astrea | That is Crusch-sama's will. 
 Emilia | What? 
 Emilia | There's a ring of criminals near the forest? 
 Ram | Yes. 
 Ram | The punitive force this messenger brought 
 Ram | already prepares to fight the enemy. 
 Emilia |" But why would Crusch-sama do
so much to help this domain? "
 Wilhelm van Astrea | The margrave sent my master a proposal 
 Wilhelm van Astrea |" for an alliance with respect
to the royal selection. "
 Wilhelm van Astrea |" The condition is a share of the
mining rights in Elior Forest. "
 Wilhelm van Astrea | Do you understand? 
 Emilia | So that's what this is about. 
 Wilhelm van Astrea |" But evacuating all the villagers
to the capital will be difficult. "
 Wilhelm van Astrea | Half of them will go to the capital. 
 Ram |" I will lead the other half to
safety in the Sanctuary. "
 Ram | Roswaal-sama is heading there now. 
 Emilia | O-Oh, I see... 
 Emilia |" Then, discussion on the
matter is already over. "
 Emilia | But isn't there something strange about this? 
 Emilia | It all seems too well-timed— 
 Subaru Natsuki | Pardon me. 
 Subaru Natsuki |" The group hiding in the forest has
been observed moving strangely. "
 Subaru Natsuki | We haven't a moment to waste! 
 Subaru Natsuki |" Once they make their move, the entire
region will be a sea of blood! "
 Subaru Natsuki | What will it be, Captain? 
 Subaru Natsuki | No, Sword Demon Wilhelm-dono? 
 Wilhelm van Astrea | Emilia-sama? 
 Emilia | I understand. 
 Emilia | I gratefully accept your kindness. 
 Emilia | Has this been explained to the villagers? 
 Ram |" They have been informed in a
timely fashion, Emilia-sama. "
 Emilia | I see... 
 Puck | Betty says she'll stay here. 
 Emilia | Puck! 
 Beatrice | Betty can't go. 
 Beatrice | I'll wait for your return, I suppose. 
 Beatrice | You don't have to worry. 
 Puck | That's what she said. 
 Puck | Well, in Betty's case, 
 Puck | the forbidden library is a much safer place. 
 Puck |" Besides, due to her contract,
she can't leave the mansion. "
 Puck | Lia, you know that, right? 
 Emilia | No fair using that as a reason... 
 Puck |" So, since my cute little sister
will be staying here, "
 Puck | we shouldn't do anything to the mansion. 
 Puck | Betty is sweet and kind, 
 Puck | but she'll show no mercy. 
 Wilhelm van Astrea | Understood, Great Spirit. 
 Puck | You should do what you want. 
 Puck | I'm on your side, and yours alone. 
 Emilia | We will evacuate. 
 Emilia | I don't want to endanger the villagers! 
 EXTRA | We're ready, miss. 
 Emilia | Um, I think there's been some kind of mistake. 
 Ram | No, given the number of people and carriages, 
 Ram | we must ask you to ride with these children. 
 Ram | It's a necessary measure. 
 Emilia | Can't we put them in a different carriage? 
 Emilia | That would be better for the children— 
 Subaru Natsuki | You think no one would want to ride with you? 
 Subaru Natsuki |" Have you asked the kids how
they feel about that? "
 Subaru Natsuki | Perhaps you just assume 
 Subaru Natsuki |" that they hate you and wouldn't
want to be around you? "
 Emilia | That isn't... 
 Emilia | I don't need to ask them. 
 Emilia | I know it's best for everyone. 
 Subaru Natsuki | Six children and one dragon-drawn carriage. 
 Subaru Natsuki | If we stumble here, 
 Subaru Natsuki | how will your wish ever come true? 
 Emilia | A-Are you... 
 Subaru Natsuki | What do you think, Petra? 
 Subaru Natsuki |" Do you refuse to ride in the
same carriage as she does? "
 EXTRA | Of course not. 
 EXTRA | Aren't you the lady with the potato stamps? 
 EXTRA |" The one who came with Subaru to
watch our radio calisthenics! "
 Emilia | Well... 
 EXTRA | We couldn't see your face, 
 EXTRA |" but we saw you having a good
time talking with Subaru! "
 EXTRA | Come and ride with us. 
 EXTRA | And me! 
 EXTRA | I wanna ride with you! 
 EXTRA | Come on, let's go! 
 EXTRA | Let's go. 
 EXTRA | Come with us! 
 EXTRA | And it's gonna be pulled by a dragon! 
 EXTRA | That's so cool! 
 Emilia | Ram, take care of things at the Sanctuary. 
 Emilia | Be sure to protect the villagers. 
 Ram | You take care, as well, Emilia-sama. 
 Emilia | I need to thank you, too. 
 Emilia | Where did he go? 
 Subaru Natsuki | Now, I get it... 
 Subaru Natsuki |" We couldn't figure out how
you guys stayed in touch. "
 Subaru Natsuki | Those metia sure are handy, huh? 
 Subaru Natsuki |" You owe a heavy price for
the crime of interrupting "
 Subaru Natsuki | my touching reunion with Emilia! 
 EXTRA | You're... 
 Wilhelm van Astrea | Too slow. 
 Subaru Natsuki | In short, we knew you were a spy. 
 Subaru Natsuki | How we learned is a trade secret. 
 Subaru Natsuki | So we set a trap for you, 
 Subaru Natsuki | the contact for the Witch's Cult. 
 Subaru Natsuki | Two hours. 
 Subaru Natsuki |" You gave your buddies a schedule
that was two hours behind. "
 Subaru Natsuki |" We'll use the time to get Emilia
and the others away, "
 Subaru Natsuki | crush the fingers that know our location, 
 Subaru Natsuki |" and make preparations to
crush your Sin Archbishop. "
 Subaru Natsuki |" Having your enemy a step ahead,
ready to destroy you... "
 Subaru Natsuki |" You're about to learn just
how terrifying that is. "
 Emilia | May the blessing of the spirits be with you. 
 Wilhelm van Astrea | Good luck. 
 Felix Argyle |" This is what enabled you to trick
Emilia-sama and chase her off? "
 Subaru Natsuki | Don't put it that way... 
 Subaru Natsuki | Even if it's accurate, it makes me sound bad! 
 Julius Euclius | That robe was woven with quite an odd spell. 
 Subaru Natsuki | It was handmade by Roswaal. 
 Subaru Natsuki |" Apparently, a spell is woven into
it that prevents recognition. "
 Subaru Natsuki | Originally, it was Emilia's... 
 Subaru Natsuki | I didn't steal it, okay? 
 Felix Argyle | Hmm... 
 Felix Argyle |" Well, the plan to correct the mistake
with the blank letter worked out! "
 Ram |" ""The letter was a
mistake... It was my fault""? "
 Felix Argyle |" And you worked so hard to convince
the villagers, Subaru-kyun ... "
 Subaru Natsuki | Please! 
 Subaru Natsuki |" Emilia's... She's a girl who will
be friends with all of you, "
 Subaru Natsuki |" so I want you to give her the
chance to convince you! "
 Subaru Natsuki | I'm sure everyone has a lot you'd like to say, 
 Subaru Natsuki |" but please let us protect you long
enough that you get that chance! "
 EXTRA | Jeez, you really are hopeless, Subaru-sama. 
 EXTRA | If you insist on protecting us so much, 
 EXTRA | what choice do we have? 
 EXTRA | Getting old is just awful. 
 EXTRA | I think my tear glands have weakened. 
 Subaru Natsuki | Thank you all... 
 EXTRA | We should be thanking you, Subaru-sama. 
 Felix Argyle | You actually moved me. 
 Subaru Natsuki | Don't bring it back up! It's embarrassing! 
 Felix Argyle | That just leaves... 
 Felix Argyle | Welcome back! How did it go? 
 Ricardo |" We pulled off a surprise attack
on the ones our location was leaked to. "
 Ricardo | If I messed up, I'll retire. 
 Ricardo | The map did a nice job showin' the way. 
 Subaru Natsuki |" Then the mark on the map
really was their base! "
 Ricardo |" I dunno if you'd call 'em fastidious or
high-strung, but it worked against 'em. "
 Ricardo | And we got what we were after. 
 Ricardo |" This should shut down their
communications network. "
 Mimi Pearlbaton | Hooray! We killed 'em all! 
 Tivey | Don't say that. It makes us sound awful. 
 Tivey | We took a prisoner, too! 
 Subaru Natsuki | A prisoner? 
 Subaru Natsuki | He isn't in the Witch's Cult... 
 Subaru Natsuki |" I wondered why you hadn't
shown up. You were caught? "
 Otto Suwen |" I don't know who you are,
but thanks for saving me. "
 Otto Suwen |" Actually, I'm really in no mood to
say and mean that, damn it! "
 Julius Euclius | Everything is ready. 
 Julius Euclius | Subaru, we can leave at any time. 
 Subaru Natsuki | Let's do this, everyone. 
 Subaru Natsuki | We'll begin as planned. 
 Subaru Natsuki | Now... 
 Subaru Natsuki | This time, we'll finish it! 
 Subaru Natsuki |" Let us show both Fate and
Sloth what we can do! "
 Petelgeuse Romanee-Conti | I've been waiting for you, believer in love. 
 Petelgeuse Romanee-Conti |" I am a Sin Archbishop of the Witch's
Cult, representing Sloth... "
 Petelgeuse Romanee-Conti | Betelgeuse Romanée-Conti! 
 Subaru Natsuki | Pleasure to meet you, great Sin Archbishop. 
 Subaru Natsuki |" If you could find it within you to add my
body and soul to your fingers' ranks, "
 Subaru Natsuki |" carrying out the Ordeal, there would
be no greater honor. "
 Petelgeuse Romanee-Conti | How wondrous, how vivacious your faith is! 
 Petelgeuse Romanee-Conti | To think there was such a devout believer. 
 Petelgeuse Romanee-Conti |" Please forgive my sloth,
for failing to find him. "
 Petelgeuse Romanee-Conti |" Forgive me! Forgive me! Forgive me!
Forgive me! Forgive me! "
 Subaru Natsuki | Please stop, Archbishop. 
 Petelgeuse Romanee-Conti | Ah... But, but, but... 
 Petelgeuse Romanee-Conti |" I have no way to atone for my sloth
and foolishness but by punishment. "
 Subaru Natsuki | That's not true. 
 Subaru Natsuki |" The witch wouldn't want to see
her beloved believer in pain. "
 Subaru Natsuki |" She would be happier to see
you carry out the Ordeal! "
 Petelgeuse Romanee-Conti | You are exactly right... 
 Petelgeuse Romanee-Conti | Yes, the Ordeal. 
 Petelgeuse Romanee-Conti | What she needs from me now is the Ordeal! 
 Petelgeuse Romanee-Conti | Your words have opened my eyes. 
 Petelgeuse Romanee-Conti | Thank you! Thank you! 
 Petelgeuse Romanee-Conti | With this Ordeal, we must test her... 
 Petelgeuse Romanee-Conti |" To learn if this half-devil
is a worthy vessel, "
 Petelgeuse Romanee-Conti | if she is worthy to put the witch into. 
 Subaru Natsuki | Put the witch into? Vessel? 
 Petelgeuse Romanee-Conti |" If she is, the witch will possess her.
If not, reject her. "
 Petelgeuse Romanee-Conti |" If she proves an unworthy
vessel for the witch, "
 Petelgeuse Romanee-Conti |" then the witch will be reborn into this
world on the coming fated day... "
 Subaru Natsuki |" You're saying Emilia is secondary,
without intrinsic value, to you? "
 Subaru Natsuki | You monster... 
 Petelgeuse Romanee-Conti |" The words inscribed in the
Gospel tell of her love. "
 Petelgeuse Romanee-Conti | All of it guides my path! 
 Petelgeuse Romanee-Conti | Show me your Gospel. 
 Petelgeuse Romanee-Conti | What is that? 
 Subaru Natsuki | Just what it looks like. A metia, Archbishop. 
 Felix Argyle | Oh, I see him! I see him! 
 Felix Argyle | His face looks just as scary as I'd heard! 
 Petelgeuse Romanee-Conti | Exactly who are you? 
 Petelgeuse Romanee-Conti | No! What are you? 
 Felix Argyle | Now, then... Tora, Tora, Tora. 
 Subaru Natsuki | Our surprise attack is a success! 
 Petelgeuse Romanee-Conti | What? Surprise attack... Surprise attack... 
 Petelgeuse Romanee-Conti | Then, what do you think of this?! 
 Petelgeuse Romanee-Conti | How? How can you see my Authority? 
 Subaru Natsuki | Who knows? 
 Subaru Natsuki | Ask the witch that left her scent all over me. 
 Subaru Natsuki | Oh, that's right. 
 Subaru Natsuki |" Unlike me, you haven't received the pass
that lets you meet the witch anytime. "
 Petelgeuse Romanee-Conti | What do you mean? 
 Petelgeuse Romanee-Conti |" How dare you speak as though you
are intimate with the witch? "
 Subaru Natsuki | We're so close, she's grabbed my heart. 
 Subaru Natsuki | Literally... 
 Petelgeuse Romanee-Conti | I-Inconceivable! 
 Petelgeuse Romanee-Conti | That cannot be! 
 Subaru Natsuki | Let's go, Patrasche! 
 Petelgeuse Romanee-Conti | Do not presume you can escape. 
 Subaru Natsuki | Here he comes, here he comes, here he comes! 
 Subaru Natsuki | He's coming, he's coming, he's coming! 
 Subaru Natsuki | Keep it up, Patrasche! 
 Petelgeuse Romanee-Conti | Futile! Impossible! 
 Petelgeuse Romanee-Conti | Vanish in the face of my diligence! 
 Subaru Natsuki | Sorry to always rely on you... 
 Subaru Natsuki | You're the best, Patrasche! 
 Petelgeuse Romanee-Conti | But... But, but, but... 
 Petelgeuse Romanee-Conti | But! 
 Petelgeuse Romanee-Conti | This is the end, the end! 
 Subaru Natsuki | You guys... 
 Subaru Natsuki | You almost caught me in that! 
 Subaru Natsuki | Thanks, though. I thought I was a goner. 
 Mimi Pearlbaton | You're welcome! Yay! 
 Tivey | Is that man in the sky the Sin Archbishop? 
 Mimi Pearlbaton | Yikes! What the heck is that?! 
 Mimi Pearlbaton | There's a man flying, all balled up! Wow! 
 Tivey | I've never seen anything so creepy in flight. 
 Subaru Natsuki | That's how it looks to you guys? 
 Subaru Natsuki | Either way, leave him to me. 
 Subaru Natsuki | Watch the rear, like we planned! 
 Tivey | Got it! You heard him, Sis! 
 Mimi Pearlbaton | Aye-aye! Hey, Bro. 
 Mimi Pearlbaton | Beat him now, and you'll look awesome! 
 Subaru Natsuki | Yeah, I got this! 
 Subaru Natsuki | Bring it on, Archbishop! 
 Petelgeuse Romanee-Conti | What... 
 Petelgeuse Romanee-Conti | Just what... What are you?! 
 Petelgeuse Romanee-Conti | That cannot be. 
 Petelgeuse Romanee-Conti |" None of this is in the Gospel,
in the guide to my destiny! "
 Petelgeuse Romanee-Conti | What... Just what are you? 
 Subaru Natsuki | You've asked that four times. 
 Subaru Natsuki |" If we're talking nightmares,
I've had far more than you. "
 Petelgeuse Romanee-Conti | Then... Then, then... You truly are Pride's... 
 Subaru Natsuki | My name is Natsuki Subaru, 
 Subaru Natsuki | the silver-haired, half-elf Emilia's knight. 
 Subaru Natsuki |" I don't know anything about this ""Pride""
stuff, but that's the only title I want. "
 Subaru Natsuki | I don't need any others. 
 Petelgeuse Romanee-Conti | This place is... 
 Subaru Natsuki | It's a place where my time once ended. 
 Subaru Natsuki | And it will be where your time ends, too. 
 Subaru Natsuki | That's what this place is. 
 Petelgeuse Romanee-Conti | If your goal was to lead me out here, 
 Petelgeuse Romanee-Conti | what have you prepared for me? 
 Subaru Natsuki | What else? Your natural enemy. 
 Subaru Natsuki | One you and I have in common... 
 Julius Euclius |" ""Natural enemy""? "
 Julius Euclius | Now, that's a fine thing to call me. 
 Julius Euclius |" I am Julius Euclius, of the
Lugunica Imperial Knights. "
 Julius Euclius | I am the Kingdom's sword that will slay you. 
 Petelgeuse Romanee-Conti | A spirit arts user, are you? 
 Petelgeuse Romanee-Conti | How truly... How truly... 
 Petelgeuse Romanee-Conti | Is this also part of your plot? 
 Petelgeuse Romanee-Conti | I have never known such humiliation! 
 Subaru Natsuki | Really? Well, make the most of it. 
 Subaru Natsuki | That's your bill for all you've done. 
 Subaru Natsuki | Let's do it, Julius. 
 Julius Euclius | Are you sure? 
 Subaru Natsuki | I won't back down, I won't bend, I can't lose. 
 Subaru Natsuki | I don't want to lose anyone else. 
 Julius Euclius | I am the man who brutally beat you. 
 Julius Euclius |" I still believe my behavior was
backed by meaning and reason, "
 Julius Euclius | but that is no more than self-justification, 
 Julius Euclius | which has nothing to do with you. 
 Julius Euclius | Can you trust me? 
 Subaru Natsuki | I hate you. 
 Julius Euclius | Yes, I know. 
 Subaru Natsuki |" Having someone break your arms
and legs like that is traumatic. "
 Subaru Natsuki | Don't you know the meaning of restraint? 
 Julius Euclius | Just so you know, I did hold back quite a bit. 
 Subaru Natsuki | Seriously? That was you holding back? 
 Subaru Natsuki | You really are the biggest jerk. 
 Subaru Natsuki | I really hate you, greatest knight. 
 Subaru Natsuki | So... 
 Subaru Natsuki | I will trust you. 
 Subaru Natsuki |" My shame attests to my knowledge
that you are an incredible knight. "
 Julius Euclius | Then, with all my soul... 
 Julius Euclius | I shall live up to that! 
 Petelgeuse Romanee-Conti | Is this farce over yet? 
 Petelgeuse Romanee-Conti |" What do you expect adding a single
spirit arts user to your ranks will do? "
 Petelgeuse Romanee-Conti |" I will defeat you all, tear apart
those who remain, "
 Petelgeuse Romanee-Conti | resume the Ordeal, and that is all. 
 Petelgeuse Romanee-Conti |" My diligence knows neither slothful
resignation nor demise! "
 Petelgeuse Romanee-Conti | Sloth! Sloth! Sloth! 
 Petelgeuse Romanee-Conti | Sloth! 
 Julius Euclius | Al Clarista! 
 Petelgeuse Romanee-Conti | You... You should not be able to see it. 
 Petelgeuse Romanee-Conti | It should be invisible to you. 
 Petelgeuse Romanee-Conti | My Unseen Hand can't be seen, can't be seen... 
 Petelgeuse Romanee-Conti | You can't see it! 
 Petelgeuse Romanee-Conti | And by two... Two people other than me! 
 Subaru Natsuki | I'm the only one who can see it, Betelgeuse. 
 Petelgeuse Romanee-Conti | Huh? 
 Subaru Natsuki | Julius can only see what I'm seeing. 
 Subaru Natsuki | It also feels much creepier than I expected. 
 Julius Euclius |" I can use Nect to consciously
share your senses, "
 Julius Euclius | as well as to maintain them for a while. 
 Julius Euclius |" When you first proposed this,
I questioned your sanity. "
 Subaru Natsuki | It worked, didn't it? 
 Subaru Natsuki | A man's all about guts. 
 Subaru Natsuki | You've gotta be open to anything. 
 Petelgeuse Romanee-Conti | Curse you, curse you... 
 Petelgeuse Romanee-Conti | Curse you! Curse you! Curse you! Curse you! 
 Petelgeuse Romanee-Conti | Curse you! 
 Subaru Natsuki |" Sharing a collective body with
you is pretty disgusting. "
 Subaru Natsuki | Let's get this over with. 
 Julius Euclius | Yes, let's. 
 Julius Euclius | Using your eyes, I shall slay him... 
 Julius Euclius | My friend, Natsuki Subaru! 
 Wilhelm van Astrea | I have a slight concern. 
 Wilhelm van Astrea |" I would like to take a small number
from our forces to eliminate it. "
 Emilia | You won't have any need of me? 
 Wilhelm van Astrea | Emilia-sama, head to safety in the carriage. 
 Wilhelm van Astrea | Do not release the children's hands. 
 Wilhelm van Astrea | You truly are master and servant. 
 Wilhelm van Astrea | Your eyes look just like his. 
 Emilia | Wilhelm-san, I— 
 Petelgeuse Romanee-Conti | This cannot be... 
 Petelgeuse Romanee-Conti | You cannot use such means, such tricks, 
 Petelgeuse Romanee-Conti | to make light of me and of my devotion! 
 Subaru Natsuki |" This is some crappy game where,
once as you're caught, it's over. "
 Subaru Natsuki | We must be crazy to entrust our lives to it, 
 Subaru Natsuki | you and me both! 
 Julius Euclius | My body is slowly getting used to this. 
 Julius Euclius | Shall we speed up? 
 Subaru Natsuki | Yeah! Don't worry, I'll keep up! 
 Subaru Natsuki | Wow. 
 Petelgeuse Romanee-Conti | Impossible. 
 Petelgeuse Romanee-Conti | Impossible, impossible, impossible, impossible. 
 Petelgeuse Romanee-Conti | Impossible! 
 Petelgeuse Romanee-Conti | Why? How can it be? 
 Petelgeuse Romanee-Conti | I thought I was loved! I am loved! 
 Petelgeuse Romanee-Conti | By the witch, the witch, the witch, the witch. 
 Petelgeuse Romanee-Conti | The witch! 
 Julius Euclius | It's time that I killed you for real! 
 Julius Euclius | Al Clauseria! 
 Petelgeuse Romanee-Conti | I will not let you do that. 
 Petelgeuse Romanee-Conti | Ul Dona! 
 Subaru Natsuki | Burn, fighting spirit! Howl, magic ball! 
 Subaru Natsuki | When I get serious, I can pitch over 120 km/h! 
 Petelgeuse Romanee-Conti | What is this? 
 Julius Euclius |" You lost because you belittled
him as powerless. "
 Julius Euclius |" My blade, of all six elements together,
will slice your very soul apart. "
 Julius Euclius | Scatter to the rainbow's end. 
 Petelgeuse Romanee-Conti | I will not let it end! 
 Petelgeuse Romanee-Conti | I have been nothing but diligent. 
 Petelgeuse Romanee-Conti | The witch's love bathes my entire body! 
 Subaru Natsuki | Julius, undo Nect! 
 Julius Euclius | Very well. 
 Subaru Natsuki | Ah... My brain... 
 Subaru Natsuki | is trembling! 
 Subaru Natsuki | Yeah, just tremble while you wait. 
 Subaru Natsuki | I'll play along with you, just this once... 
 Subaru Natsuki | What are you saying? Who are you talking to? 
 Subaru Natsuki | To the witch that you've been waiting for! 
 Subaru Natsuki | I can Return by Death to— 
 Petelgeuse Romanee-Conti | At last. 
 Petelgeuse Romanee-Conti | I've waited so long. 
 Petelgeuse Romanee-Conti |" For your love, your merciful love,
your affectionate love... "
 EXTRA | No. 
 EXTRA | You are not the one. 
 Subaru Natsuki | I'm back! 
 Petelgeuse Romanee-Conti | This... cannot... be... 
 Subaru Natsuki |" I was prepared to keep
trying until you left me, "
 Subaru Natsuki |" but you gave up after one go?
How cowardly can you be? "
 Julius Euclius | This time, I will end you. 
 Petelgeuse Romanee-Conti | Why... 
 Petelgeuse Romanee-Conti | Why, why, why? 
 Petelgeuse Romanee-Conti | After everything I've done for you! 
 Petelgeuse Romanee-Conti | Witch! Witch! 
 Petelgeuse Romanee-Conti | Give me your love... 
 Subaru Natsuki | Betelgeuse Romanée-Conti... 
 Subaru Natsuki | You were Sloth, all right. 
 Julius Euclius | Subaru, let us hurry back to the village. 
 Julius Euclius | Felis just contacted me. 
 Julius Euclius | It seems there is a problem. 
 Felix Argyle |" The magic stones of fire that were
in the merchants' inventory are gone. "
 Otto Suwen |" We unloaded all our cargo so we
could transport the villagers. "
 Otto Suwen | But the magic stones of fire are missing. 
 Subaru Natsuki | What does that mean? 
 Felix Argyle |" Someone left the stones on board
when they loaded the villagers. "
 Otto Suwen | It was Ketty-san's carriage. 
 Otto Suwen |" There are enough magic stones to
easily blow away a small village. "
 Felix Argyle |" Ketty's carriage is taking Emilia-sama
and the children to the capital. "
 EXTRA | Emilia-sama... 
 EXTRA | It's time. 
 EXTRA | What's wrong? 
 EXTRA | Are you okay? 
 Emilia | I'm sorry. It's nothing. 
 Emilia | Come on, let's hurry! 
 Subaru Natsuki | Damn it! 
 Subaru Natsuki |" My poor man's tendency to use
anything at hand backfired! "
 Julius Euclius |" We have verified that no spell
was used to set a trap, "
 Julius Euclius |" but if something were physically
rigged in the carriage... "
 Felix Argyle | Felis, could a ground dragon catch up to them? 
 Felix Argyle |" Once they leave the Mathers domain
and get on the Lifaus Highway, "
 Felix Argyle | it'll be hard to catch them. 
 Subaru Natsuki | That still wasn't enough? 
 Subaru Natsuki | Even after all that, I still can't... 
 Otto Suwen | May I say something? 
 Otto Suwen |" Right now, I'm actually
in a desperate position. "
 Otto Suwen | If you would accept a trade, 
 Otto Suwen |" I promise to catch up to
the carriage that lef— "
 Subaru Natsuki | If there's anything I can do, I'll do it! 
 Otto Suwen |" I like a man who can decide
quickly, Natsuki-san! "
 Julius Euclius | I'll send Ia with you. 
 Julius Euclius | I wish I could accompany you myself, but... 
 Felix Argyle | You can't, Julius. 
 Felix Argyle |" With all those injuries, how could
you help them? "
 Felix Argyle | And your mana's nyot restored yet, either. 
 Subaru Natsuki | You just get some rest. 
 Subaru Natsuki | Once this is over, we'll celebrate! 
 Subaru Natsuki | I'll make sure to invite you, so don't die. 
 Felix Argyle | Don't you die, either! 
 Subaru Natsuki | Good luck. 
 Otto Suwen | Rather than take this road, 
 Otto Suwen |" it's faster to go through
the glade to the left. "
 Otto Suwen | It's the shortest way! 
 Subaru Natsuki |" Man, your ""soul of language""
divine protection is amazing. "
 Otto Suwen | I had a hard time learning to control it. 
 Otto Suwen |" Since I can hear all creatures' voices,
from ground dragons to insects. "
 Subaru Natsuki |" But if we choose our path
based on what they say, "
 Subaru Natsuki |" this shortcut will work, and catching up
to Emilia and the kids will be easy! "
 Otto Suwen | What are you talking about? 
 Otto Suwen | It won't be easy at all! 
 Subaru Natsuki | We're gonna die! 
 Subaru Natsuki | At this rate, we're seriously gonna die. 
 Subaru Natsuki | What next?! 
 Otto Suwen | What is this? I feel a wind hitting me. 
 Otto Suwen |" Honestly, even I had no idea
I was capable of this— "
 Subaru Natsuki | What is it? What's wrong? 
 Otto Suwen | The trees are so loud. 
 Otto Suwen |" The birds and bugs began to make
a lot of noise, and then just vanished. "
 Otto Suwen | Something... Something is coming! 
 Subaru Natsuki |" Faster, Otto! Don't get
caught, no matter what! "
 Otto Suwen | Natsuki-san? 
 Subaru Natsuki | Just how persistent are you, damn it?! 
 Petelgeuse Romanee-Conti | My body! 
 Petelgeuse Romanee-Conti | My flesh body! 
 Emilia | It's okay. Hang on tight. 
 Emilia | There's nothing to fear. 
 Puck |" That old man just ran into
someone behind us. "
 Puck | They're fighting. 
 Emilia | Do you know how many? 
 Puck | A lot. 
 Puck | But the old man's power is no joke. 
 Puck | Seems you and I won't be needed this time. 
 Puck |" Taking physical form without
reason drains mana, "
 Puck |" and I wouldn't want these
kids ending up their toys. "
 Emilia |" If we could hide everyone's
fear behind your cuteness, "
 Emilia | I think that could work, though. 
 Puck | You say some scary things, my daughter. 
 Emilia | Don't worry. 
 Emilia | Whatever happens, I'll protect you. 
 EXTRA | W-We're fine! 
 EXTRA | You don't have to worry about us! 
 EXTRA | W-We made a promise, so this is nothing! 
 Emilia | A promise? 
 EXTRA | That we wouldn't let you go! 
 EXTRA |" Because if we aren't with you,
you'll do something crazy! "
 EXTRA | And he'll worry if someone doesn't watch you! 
 Emilia | Worry about me? Who told you this? 
 EXTRA | Don't! We can't tell— 
 EXTRA | Subaru! 
 EXTRA | Subaru said it. 
 EXTRA |" He said you get lonely easily,
so he was worried! "
 EXTRA | Subaru said... 
 EXTRA | Wait, we weren't supposed to tell her. 
 EXTRA | Oh, boy... 
 Otto Suwen |" Natsuki-san, is something
coming up behind us? "
 Subaru Natsuki | Just some big, black animal. 
 Subaru Natsuki |" It has a wild voice and a scary face,
so you're better off not looking. "
 Otto Suwen | Those things make me all the more curious! 
 Subaru Natsuki | Forget it! Just drive! 
 Subaru Natsuki | If it bites me, it'll munch on you next! 
 Otto Suwen | Yikes! 
 Subaru Natsuki |" How many times do I have
to play the last level? "
 Subaru Natsuki |" What about you is slothful now,
you uselessly hard worker? "
 Petelgeuse Romanee-Conti | Witch! Satella! Give me... 
 Petelgeuse Romanee-Conti | Love! Love! 
 Subaru Natsuki | She doesn't love you or me... 
 Petelgeuse Romanee-Conti | Love! Love! Love! Love! Love! 
 Subaru Natsuki |" In what kind of rom-com does someone
try to squash their love's heart? "
 Petelgeuse Romanee-Conti | Satella! Satella! Satella! 
 Subaru Natsuki | I am your opponent. 
 Subaru Natsuki | I won't let you past me. 
 Subaru Natsuki |" And I absolutely won't let you
get to the kid in front of me! "
 Otto Suwen | Natsuki-san, you care about me that much? 
 Subaru Natsuki | Will you be quiet? 
 Subaru Natsuki | I'm trying to make myself look good. 
 Subaru Natsuki | Take this! 
 Otto Suwen | Natsuki-san, we're leaving the forest! 
 Petelgeuse Romanee-Conti | Love... 
 Petelgeuse Romanee-Conti | Love... Love me. 
 Petelgeuse Romanee-Conti | Love alone is everything! 
 Subaru Natsuki | I can't take you with me to where Emilia is! 
 Subaru Natsuki | I'm gonna need your strength, 
 Subaru Natsuki | Julius Euclius! 
 Subaru Natsuki | Rental Goa! 
 Subaru Natsuki | Damn, that hurts... 
 Petelgeuse Romanee-Conti | Give it to me. 
 Petelgeuse Romanee-Conti | Hand it over. 
 Subaru Natsuki | I told you... 
 Subaru Natsuki |" If you try to enter my body,
you're just gonna get hurt! "
 Petelgeuse Romanee-Conti | The witch... Satella... Satella! 
 Petelgeuse Romanee-Conti |" I haven't forgotten a single moment
of the things you did for me! "
 Petelgeuse Romanee-Conti | Even if you've forgotten, I'll... I'll... 
 Petelgeuse Romanee-Conti | With all of my diligence, 
 Petelgeuse Romanee-Conti |" I'll part with my slothful self,
to repay your love... "
 Subaru Natsuki | If you had stayed a monster... 
 Subaru Natsuki | You might have beaten me! 
 Petelgeuse Romanee-Conti | Satella... 
 Petelgeuse Romanee-Conti | I... will not... I won't... let it end. 
 Petelgeuse Romanee-Conti | This hasn't ended... 
 Petelgeuse Romanee-Conti | It hasn't. 
 Subaru Natsuki | No, it's over. 
 Subaru Natsuki | As of now, you 
 Subaru Natsuki | are finished! 
 Petelgeuse Romanee-Conti | Natsuki Subaru! 
 Subaru Natsuki | This time, stay asleep forever, Betelgeuse. 
 Otto Suwen | Natsuki-san, look! 
 Subaru Natsuki | Wilhelm-san! 
 Wilhelm van Astrea | Subaru-dono! 
 Subaru Natsuki | Where's Emilia? 
 Wilhelm van Astrea | Just ahead. 
 Wilhelm van Astrea | Go straight, toward the great tree. 
 Wilhelm van Astrea | This is the perfect chance to repay my debt. 
 Wilhelm van Astrea |" Who can stand in the way of a man
on his way to see a woman? "
 Otto Suwen | Natsuki-san, I see it! 
 Otto Suwen | That's the carriage with the refugees! 
 Subaru Natsuki | Back then, I promised. 
 Subaru Natsuki | No matter what it takes... 
 Subaru Natsuki | I'm going to save you. 
 Puck | Are you thinking about Subaru? 
 Emilia | Yeah. 
 Emilia | But I still can't believe it. 
 Puck | If Subaru's really leading the army, 
 Puck | lots of things would make sense. 
 Ram | Like why Ram didn't argue, 
 Ram | and why the villagers agreed to evacuate. 
 Emilia | But why? 
 Emilia |" After all the pain and suffering
he went through... "
 Emilia | After I made him look so sad... 
 Emilia | Why would he... 
 Puck | Lia, something is coming up behind us. 
 Subaru Natsuki | Found them! 
 Puck |" I thought this reunion was sudden.
So that's why you're here. "
 Emilia | Wait! Why? 
 Emilia | Why? 
 Subaru Natsuki | I love you, Emilia. 
 Subaru Natsuki | Damn it! 
 Subaru Natsuki | Get there in time! 
 Emilia | Thank you, Subaru. 
 Emilia | For saving me. 
 Subaru Natsuki | Where am I? 
 Subaru Natsuki | I can't see a thing. 
 Subaru Natsuki | I can't hear a thing. 
 Subaru Natsuki |" Is that witch lady coming
to grab my heart again? "
 Subaru Natsuki | I don't feel too bad, though. 
 Emilia | Subaru! 
 Emilia | Subaru! 
 Emilia | Subaru! 
 Subaru Natsuki | Oh, hey. I can hear, after all. 
 Emilia | Subaru! 
 Emilia | Subaru, you're awake? 
 Emilia | Thank goodness... I'm so glad. 
 Subaru Natsuki | I'm lying down, and Emilia is kneeling. 
 Subaru Natsuki |" And considering our distance and the
heavenly sensation under my head... "
 Emilia | You don't have to go through all that. 
 Emilia |" Your head is on my lap. It isn't
uncomfortable, is it? "
 Subaru Natsuki | I know of no finer, more divine pillow. 
 Subaru Natsuki | Um... 
 Subaru Natsuki | Can I ask how things turned out? 
 Emilia | Honestly... 
 Emilia | I'm the one who wants to ask what's going on. 
 Subaru Natsuki | Is Patrasche okay? 
 Subaru Natsuki |" I wanna become the wind
with that little guy again. "
 Emilia | He was pretty burned, 
 Emilia | but he'll be fine. 
 Emilia | Felis is looking at him. 
 Subaru Natsuki | Oh, Felis joined us, too? 
 Subaru Natsuki | Have I been out for a pretty long time? 
 Emilia | About an hour or two. 
 Subaru Natsuki | Then, everyone's together now? 
 Emilia | Julius, as well. 
 Emilia | I was really surprised. 
 Emilia | I never expected to see you two together. 
 Subaru Natsuki | It was for reasons bluer than the mountains, 
 Subaru Natsuki | and taller than the seas, Emilia-tan. 
 Subaru Natsuki | I finally made it back. 
 Subaru Natsuki | I feel like I was having a really long dream. 
 Subaru Natsuki | A terrible dream... 
 Subaru Natsuki | No, it wasn't. 
 Emilia | A good dream, then? 
 Subaru Natsuki | A good reality. 
 Subaru Natsuki | Back then, you asked me why... 
 Subaru Natsuki | Why I saved you, 
 Subaru Natsuki | why I try so hard at everything. 
 Subaru Natsuki | You asked me why. 
 Emilia | Yeah. 
 Emilia | And you said it was because I saved you... 
 Emilia | But I haven't done anything like that. 
 Emilia | I've never been able to. 
 Emilia | You're the one who's always saving me. 
 Emilia | I never could do anything for you. 
 Emilia |" And yet, you got yourself hurt,
and said it was for my sake... "
 Subaru Natsuki | No, I was messed up back then. 
 Subaru Natsuki | I was thinking only of myself. 
 Subaru Natsuki | I said it was all for you, 
 Subaru Natsuki |" when I was really just drunk on
the idea of doing it for you. "
 Subaru Natsuki |" I had it in my head that if I
said that, you'd accept it. "
 Emilia | Subaru... 
 Subaru Natsuki | I'm sorry. 
 Subaru Natsuki | I used you for my own self-satisfaction. 
 Subaru Natsuki | Everything you said back then was true. 
 Subaru Natsuki | I was wrong. 
 Subaru Natsuki | But... 
 Subaru Natsuki | There's one thing I wasn't wrong about. 
 Subaru Natsuki | I want to save you. 
 Subaru Natsuki | I want to help you. 
 Subaru Natsuki | I honestly mean that. It's no lie. 
 Emilia | Yeah. I know. 
 Emilia | Why do you always save me? 
 Subaru Natsuki | Because I love you. 
 Subaru Natsuki | And I want to be your strength. 
 Emilia | I'm a half-elf... 
 Subaru Natsuki | I know that. 
 Emilia | I'm a silver-haired half-elf, 
 Emilia |" and many people hate me because
I look like the witch. "
 Emilia | They despise me... 
 Emilia | They absolutely detest me! 
 Subaru Natsuki | I saw. I know. 
 Subaru Natsuki | Those guys are all blind. 
 Emilia | I don't have much experience with people, 
 Emilia | so I don't have friends. 
 Emilia |" I'm naïve and not very worldly, so I
say strange things sometimes. "
 Emilia |" And the reason I want to be the kingdom's
ruler is really, really selfish. "
 Subaru Natsuki | No matter what anyone says about you, 
 Subaru Natsuki | no matter what you think of yourself, 
 Subaru Natsuki | I love you. 
 Subaru Natsuki | I really love you! Like crazy! 
 Subaru Natsuki | I want to be with you all the time. 
 Subaru Natsuki | I want to hold your hand all the time. 
 Subaru Natsuki |" If you name ten things
you hate about yourself, "
 Subaru Natsuki | I'll say two thousand things I love about you. 
 Subaru Natsuki | That's the kind of 
 Subaru Natsuki | special treatment I want to give you. 
 Emilia |" That's the first time I've received special
treatment that made me happy... "
 Emilia | Why two thousand? 
 Subaru Natsuki |" Because a hundredfold isn't enough
to express how I feel about you. "
 Emilia | I'm happy... 
 Emilia | I'm so happy. 
 Emilia | I never even imagined I'd see the day 
 Emilia | that someone told me they loved me. 
 Emilia | What should I do? 
 Emilia | You've told me so many of your feelings, 
 Emilia | but I don't know what to do... 
 Subaru Natsuki | You don't have to stress over it. 
 Subaru Natsuki | I'm not demanding an answer right away. 
 Subaru Natsuki |" As far as I'm concerned, it's written in
stone that you'll give me an answer. "
 Subaru Natsuki | And it'll be a positive one, at that. 
 Emilia | Is it really all right? 
 Emilia |" For me... For someone like me to be
given such happiness all the time? "
 Emilia | To be so overjoyed... 
 Emilia | I actually feel like it's indulgent. 
 Subaru Natsuki | Sure, it is. Go on and be indulgent. 
 Subaru Natsuki | You can never have too much happiness. 
 Subaru Natsuki |" If you have so much that it overflows,
you can always share it. "
 Subaru Natsuki | You can take your time, Emilia. 
 Subaru Natsuki |" You can take your time and slowly,
steadily fall in love with me. "
 Subaru Natsuki |" I'll do my best, so I can walk by your side.
So you'll fall head over heels for me. "
 Emilia | Thank you, Subaru... 
 Emilia | For saving me.
